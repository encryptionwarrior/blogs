### Windows: File Permission
In Windows, files and directory permissions are assigned suing Acess Control Lists or ACLs. Specifically, we're gonna work with Discretionaries Access Controls Lists or DACLs.
- Windows files and folders can also have System Access Control Lists or SACLs assigned to them.
- Read 
Lets yoo see that a file exists, and allows you to read its contents. It also lets you read the files and directories in a directory.

- Read & Execute 
Lets you read files, and if the file is an executable, you can run the file. 
- Read & Execute includes Read, so if you select Read & Execute, Read will be automatically selected.
- List folder contents 
An alias for Read & Execute on a directory.

- Write 
Lets yoy can make changes to a file. 

- The Wriye permissions also lets you create subdirectories, and write to files in the directory.

- Modify 
The modify permission is an umbrella permission that includes the read, execute, and write.

- Full Control 
A user or group with full control can do anything they want to the file. 
- icacls
- Improved changes ACLS 
- `icacls /?`

### File Permission 
- Read 
Allows someone to read the contents of a file or folder 

- Write
Allow someone to write information to a file or folder.

- Execute
Allows someone to execute a program 
- w=writable 
- `ls -l ~/my_life`


### Windows: Modifying Permissions
- GUI 
- icacls
- `icacls "C:\Vacation Pictures" /grant Everyone:(OI)(CI)(R)`
- Everyone 
- `icacls "C:\Vacation Pictures" /grant 'Everyone:(OI)(CI)(R)'`

- Guest users 
A special type of user that's allowed to user the computer without a pasword.
- Authenticated Users 
- `icacls "C:\Vacation Pictures" /grant 'Everyone:(OI)(CI)(R)'`
- `icacls "C:\Vacation Pictures" /grant 'Authenticated users:(OI)(CI)(R)'`
- `icacls "C:\Vacation Pictures" /remove Everyone`
- `icacls "C:\Vacation Pictures"`

### Linux: Modifying Permissions
- chmod
- The owner, which is denoted by a u 
- The group the file belogs to, which is denoted by g 
- Other users, which is denoted by an o 
- + or - 
- `ls -l my_cool_file`
-  `chmod u+X my_cool_file`
- `ls -l my_cool_file`
-  `chmod u-X my_cool_file`
- `ls -l my_cool_file`
symbolic format 

- The numeric equivalent of rwx is:
    - 4 for read or r
    - 2 for write or w
    - 1 for execute or x
- `ls -l my_cool_file`
- `chmod 754 my_cool_file`
- `ls -l my_cool_file`

- If you add 4, 2, and 1 together you get r,w,x which is equals 7, so our owner permission is able to read, write and execute thsi file. 
- $ + 1 is read and execute
- `chmod u+rwx my_cool_file`
- `chmod g+rx my_cool_file`
- `chmod o+r my_cool_file`
- chown 
- `chmod 754 my_cool_file`
- `sudo chown devan my_cool_file`
- `ls -l my_cool_file`
- chgrp 
- `sudo chgrp best_group_ever my_cool_file`
- `ls -l my_cool_file`

### Linux: SetUID, SetGId, Sticky Bit

 - SetGID
 - sticky bit
- `sudo chmod 2755 my_cool_file`
- `ls -l /usr/bin/passwd`
- The symbolic bit is a t and the numerical bit is a 1.
- `sudo chmod 1755 my_folder`
- `ls -ld  my_folder`
