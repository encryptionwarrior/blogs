### Remote Connection and SSH
- Work desktop vs Home Computer
Ex: Transfer data from home computer to remote computer

- Remote Shell(SSH)
A protocoal implemented by other programs to securely access one computer from another.
- Shell code:
```
ssh cindy@104.131.122.215
```
- Private
- Public
- Virtual Private Network(VPN)
Allows you to connect to a private network, like your work network, over the internet.

### Operatinfg System
Remote connections on windows
- PuTTY
A free, open source software that you can use to make remote connections through several network protocols, including SSH.
- PuTTY configuarions
```
putty.exe -ssh cindy@104.141.122.215 22
```
- Remote Desktop Protocol
- Microoft Terminal Services Client
- Remote connection using GUI

### Components of an Operating System
- Operatinfg System:
The whole package that manages our computer's resources and let us interact with it.

- User Spaces Applications
- Kernal Spaces:
    - Process manager
    - Memory manager
    - File manager
    - I/O manager
- Hardware

- System programs
- User Interfaces

- Windows
- Mac
- Linux
- Ubuntu
- Debian
- Red Hat

- Our kernel optmizes memoru usage and makes sure our applications have enough memory to run.
- I/O Management
Anything that can give us input, or that we can use for Output of  data.

- File management
- Process management
- Memory management
- I/O management

### Files and File systems
- File handling
- Data 
- Metadata
- File System
- NTFS
- Encryption
- Faster access speeds
- Security
- ReFs
- HFS+
- ext4
- We write data to our hard drive in the form of adata blocks
- Block storage:
Imroves faster handling of adata because the data isn't stored as one long piece and can be accessed quicker.

- File -> Metadata
    - File Owner
    - Permissions
    - File Size
    - Date Modified
    - Date Created
    - File Type

- File extension
The appended part of a filename that tells us what type of file it is in certain operating systems.

### Process management
- process:
A program that's executing, like our internet browser or text editor.
- Program:
Am application that we can run, like Chrome.

- User Space
- Kernel - Processes
- Hardware

- Time slice
A very short interval of time that gets allocated to a process for CPU execution

- Kernel
Creates processes, efficiently schedules them, and manages how processes are terminated

### Memory management
- Virtual Memory 
The combination of hard drive spces and RAM that acts like memory that our processes can use 

- Program -> Pages 
    - Virtual Memory - RAM, Hard drive Spaces
        - Physical Memory -RAM


### I/O Management
- I/O Devices 
Devices that perform input and Output
- Ehen you're troubleshooting or solving a problem with a slow machine, it's usually so sort of hardware resource  deficiency.

### Ineract with the OS: User Space
- Shell
- Graphical User interface 

- Shell
A program that interprets text commands and sends the to the OS to execute.
- Bourne Again Shell
- Powershell


### Logs 
Files that record system events on our computer, just like a system's diary.

### The Boot Process 
- BIOS/UEFI
A low-level software that initializes ourcomputer's hardware to makesure everything is good to go.
- Poer on Self Test

- Poer On  -> BIOS/UEFI -> Boot Device -> Boot loader -> OS -> Kernel -> system process
- Bootloader 
A small program that loads the operating system.
