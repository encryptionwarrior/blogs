#### Failure as Feedback
- It's projected that IT jobs in the US alone will grow 12% in the next decade.
- There are thousands of companies around the world searching for IT professionals like you!.

#### Course Introduction
- Computers are everywhere


### From Abacus to Analytical Engine
###### Computers
- A device that store and process data by performing calculations.

###### QWERTY
###### Punch Cards
###### Algorithms
A series of steps that solve specific problems.

### The Path to Modern Computers
#### Cryptography
The art of writing and solving codes.

###### Typewriter
###### RelayDisk
###### ENIAC
###### Hello World
Programming Language -> Mechine level -> Binary Codes
##### IBM Computers and Microsoft - Bill Gates
##### GNU
##### Open source
Anyone could modify and share it.
##### PDAs


### Computer Lanugage
#### Binary System
- The communication that a computer uses, also known as a base-2 numeral system.
- We group binary into 8 numbers or bits
- A group of 8 bits referred to as a bites.
- Each byte can store one character, and we can have 256 possible values thanks to the base-2 system

- What does following translate to? 
01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101100  


### Character Encoding
Assing our binary values to characters, so that we as a human can read them. 
Ex. Emojis and their binary values
- ASCII
- The first character in the ASCII yo binary table -- a lowercase a -- maps to 01100001 in binary.
- UTF-8
- 11110000:10011111:10011000:10000001 -> Laughing Emojis
- Color pallets

### Binary
- Ex. Switch and Bulb
##### Logic Gates
Allow our transistors to do more complex tasks. like decide where to send electrical signal depending on logical conditions.

### How to count in binary.

### Abstraction
To take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use.
Ex. Engine, Car, Staring

### Computer Architecture Overview
- Hardware Layer: Made up of the physical components of a computer.
- Operating System: Allow hardware to communicate with system.
- Software Layer: How we as a human interact with our computer.
- User: interact with the computers.
