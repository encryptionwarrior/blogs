- Hardware

- Port:
Connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer.

- Central Processing Unit(CPU)
The brain of our computer, it does all the calculations and data processing.

- Random Access Memory(RAM):
Our computer's short term memory.

- Hard drive:
Holds all of our data, which includes all of our music, pictures, applications.

- Motherboard:
The body or circulatory system of the computer that connects all the pieces together.

### Programs and Hardware
- Program: Intructions that tell computer what to do.
- EX: Cover book, chef, and reciepe

- External Data Bus
- Registers
- Memory controller Chip
- Address Bus

- There are 3 different cache levels in a CPU: L1, L2 and L3.
- L1 is the smallest and fastest

- Clock Cycle
- Clock Speed
The maximum number of clock cycles that it can handle in a certain time period.
- 3.40 gigahurtz is 3.4 billion cycles per second.
- Overclocking:

### CPU
- EX: Chip -> set of instructions book -> Intrusctions
- Adding, Subtracting, Copying data
- Replacing Failed hard disk, Upgrading Ram Modules, Installing Video cards.
- Intel, AMD, QUALCOMM
- INterl i7, AMD Athelon, Snapgragon 810, Apple A8
- When you select your CPU, You'll need to make sure it's compatible with your motherboard -- that circuit board that connects all your components together. 
- Land Grid Array(LGA)
- Pin Grid Array(PGA)
- Heat Sink

### Ram
- There are lots of types of RAM, and the one that's commonly found in computer is DRAM, or dyanamic random access memory.
- There are also lots of types of memory sticks that DRAM chips can be put on. The more modern DIMM sticks, which usually stads for Dual Inline Memory Module, have different sizes of pins of them.
- Synchronous DRAM
- IN today's system we can use another types of RAM, called double data rate or SDRAM or DDR SDRAM for short.
- DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4


### Motherboards
- Chpset
- North bridge, South bridge
- CPU, RAM, Peripherals
- Peripherals:
External device we connect to our computers, like a mouse keyboard or monitor.
- Expasion slots:
Give us the ability to increase the functionality of our computer.
- PCI Express(Peripheral components interconnect Express)
- Form Factor
- ATX(Advanced Technology Extended)
- ITX(Information Technology Extended)


### Storage
| 8 bits                  | 1 byte |
|---------------------------------|-------------|
| 1024 bytes           | 1 kilobyte(KB) |
| 1o24 kilobytes         | 1 megabyte(MB) |
| 1024 megabytes          | 1 gigabyte(GB) |
| 1024 gigabytes          | 1 terabyte(TB) |

- Hardk disk drives
- Revolution per minute
- Solid State drive
- HDD(Hard Disk Drive)
- SSD(Solid State Drive)
- ATA
- SATA
- NVM Express
- NVMe

### Power Supplies
- DC - AC
- AS a general rule, be sure to use the proper voltage for your electronics.

- Wattage
The amount of volts and amps that a device needs

- You can power most basic desktops with a 500W power supply.

### Peripherals
Anything that you connect to your computer externally that adds functionality.
- Universal Serial Bus
    - USB 2.0 Transfer spped of 480 Mb/s
    - USB 3.0 Transfer spped of 5 Gb/s
    - USB 3.1 Transfer spped of 10 Gb/s
- MB is megabyte or unit of data storage, while MB/s is a megabit per second, which is a unitof data transfer rate.
- Remember that 1 byte is 8 bit, so to transfer a 1MB file in a second, you need an 8 Mb/s connection spped.
- Type-C connector
- DVI
- HDMI
- Display Port


### BIOS
- Read-only memory chip
- UEFI(Unified Expensible Firmware Interface)
- Power-on self test
- CMOS chip
