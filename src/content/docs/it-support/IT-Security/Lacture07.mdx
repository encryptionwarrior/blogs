### Network Hardening Best Practices  
- Network hardening  
The process of securing a network by reducing its potential vaulnerabilities through configuration changes specific steps  

- Implicit deny  
A network security concept where anything not explicitly permitted or allowed should be denied  

- Analyzing logs   
The practice of collecting logs from different network and sometimes client devices on your network, then performing an automated analysis on them  

- Logs analysis systems are configured using defined rules to match interesting or atypical log entries.  


- Normalizing log data is an important step, since logs from different devices and systems may not be formatted in a common way  

- Correletion analysis  
The process of taking log data from different systems and matching events across the systems  

- post-fail analysis  
- Flood Guards   
Provide protection against DoS or deniel of service attacks  


- Network seperation  

### Network Hardware Hardening  
- DHCPDISCOVER  

- Rouge DHCP server attack 
- DHCP snooping  
- Dyanamic ARP inspection  
- IP Source Guard  
- 802.1X  

- Extensible Authentication Protocol(EAPOL)  
- EAP-TLS  
An authentication type supported by EAP that uses TLS to provide mutual authentication of both the client and authenticating server  

### Network Software Hardening  
- Firewalls  
- Proxies 
- VPNs 

- VPNs are commonly used to provide secure remote access, and link two networks securily  

- proxy server  
- HAPROxy 
- Nginx 
- Apache web server 

### WEP Encryption and Why You Shouldn't Use it  
- What do you think the best security option is for securing a WiFi network?  

- Wired Equivalent Privacy  

- No one should be using WEP anymore!  

- Open System authentication 
- Shared key authentication  


### Let's Get Rid of WEP! WPA/WPA2  
- Wi-Fi Protected Access 

- WPA  
Designed as a short-term replacement that would be compatible with older WEP-enabled hardware with a simple firmware update  

- Temporary Key Integrity Protocol  

- Under WPA, the pre-shared key is the WiFi password you share with open when they come over and what to use your wireless network 

- Pasword-Based Key Derivation Funtion 2 

- CCMP  
Counter Mode CBC-MAC Protocol  

- Four-way handshake  
-Pairwise transient Key  

- PMK 
- AP nonce  
- Client nonce  
- AP MAC address  
- Client MAC address  

- WPA2-Enterprise

- WPA2-Personal 
- WPA2-PSK  

- PIN entry authentication 
- NFC or USB 
- Push-button authentication 

- Rainbow tables  


### Wireless hardnening  
- 802.1X with EAP-TLS  

- If 802.1X is too complicated for a company, the next best alternative would be WPA2 with AES/CCMP mode.  

- A long and complex passphrases that wouldn't be found in a dictionary would increase the amount of time and resources an attacker would need to break the passphrase  

- If your company values security over convinience, you should make sure that WPS isn't enabled on your APs.  

### Sniffing the Network  
- Packet sniffing(packet capture)  
The process of inercepting network packets in their entirety for analysis.  

- promicuous Mode  
A type of computer networking operational mode in which all network data packets can be accessed and viewed by all network adapters operating on this mode  

- Port mirroring   
Allows the switch to take all packets from a specified port, port range, or entire VLAN and mirror the packets to a specified switch port  

- Monitor mode   
Allows us to scan across channels to see all wireless traffic being sent by APs and client  

### Wireshark and TCPdump  
- Tcpdump   
A super popular, lightweight, command-line based utility that you can use to capture and analyze packets.  

- Wireshark   
http.request.uri matches "q=wireshark"  

- Traffic analysis  

### intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems(IDS/IPS)   
IDS or IPS systems operate by monitoring network traffic and analyzing it.  

- network Intrusion Detection system(NIDS)   
The detection system would be deployed somewhere on a nettwork where it can monitor traffic for a network segment or subnet.  

- Network Based IDS  
- Host Based IDS 

- Port mirroring functionality 
- snort 
- suricata  
- Bro NIDS  

- Network Intrusion Prevention System
