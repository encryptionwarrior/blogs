### Cryptography 
- Encryption   
The act of taking a message, called plaintext, and applting an opeation to it, called a cipher, so that you receive a garbled, unreadable message as the output, called ciphertext.

- Decryption  
- Holly Wyrld

- key  
- Encryption algorithm  
The underlying logic of process that's used to convert the plaintext into ciphertext  

- Security through obscurity  

- Kerchoff's principle  

- Cryptosystem  
A collection of algorithms for key generation and encryption and decryption operations that comprise a cryptography service should remain secure - even if everything about the system is known, except the key  

- Shannon's maxim  
The system should remain secure even if your adversary knows exactly what kind of encryption systems you're employing, as long as your keys remain secure.  

- Cryptology  
- Cryptoanalysis  

- Frequency analysis  
The practice of stuying the frequency with letters appear in a ciphertext  

- e t a o 
- th er on an  

- Stenography  
The practice of hiding information from observers, but not encoding it

### Symmetric Cryptography  
- Symmetric-key algorithm  

- Substition cipher  
An encryption mechanism that replaces parts of your plaintext with ciphertext  

- Caesar Cipher  

- Stream cipher  
Takes a stream of input and encrypts the stream one character or one digits at a time, outputting one encrypted character or digit at a time.

- Block ciphers   
The picker takes data in, places it into a bucket or block of data that's fixed size, then encodes that entire block as one unit.  


- Initialization vector  

### Symmetric Encryption Algorithms  
- SData Encryption Standard  

- FIPS  
Federal Information Processing standard  

- Key length  
- Brute-force attack  
- 2 <pre>56</pre>

- National Institute of standards & technology  

- Advanced Encryption Standard  

- Because of large key size, brute-force attacks on AES are only theoritical right now, because the computing power required(or time required using moderm technology) exceeds anything feasible today.  

- An important thing to keep in mind when considering various encrytpion algorithms is speed and ease of implementation.

- RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4)  
A symmtric stram cipher that gained widespread adoption because of its simplicity and speed  

- TLS 1.2 with AES GCM  

### Asymmetric Cryptography  
- Asymmetric or public key ciphers  
- Public key signatures  

- Confidetiality  
- Authenticity  
- Non-repudiation  

- Message Authentication Codes(MACs)  
- MAC  
A bit of information that allows authentication of a received message, ensuring that he message came from the alleged sender and not a third party  

- HMAC  
Key-hash message authentication code  

- CMACs 
Cipher-Based Message Authentication Codes  

- CBC-MAC  
Cipher block chaining messge authentication codes  


### Asymmetic Encryption Algorithms (RSA)  
- Digital Signature Algorithm  
- Diffie-Hellman  

- Elliptic curve crytography(ECC)  
A public-key encryption system that uses the algrebic structures of elliptic curves over finite fields to generfate secure keys  


- Both Diffie-Hellmen and DSA have elliptic curve variants, referred to as ECDH and ECDSA, respectively.
