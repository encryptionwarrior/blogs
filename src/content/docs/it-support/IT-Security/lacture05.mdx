### Disabling Unnecessary Componets  
- 0-day vulnerablity  
- Attack vectors  
The method or machanism by which an attacker or malware gains access to a network or system  

- Attack surfaces  
The sum of all the different attack vectors in a given system  

- The less complex something is, the less likely there will be undetected flaws  

- Another way to keep things simple is to decuver your software deployments.  

- Telnet access for a managed switch has no business being enabled in a real-world environement. 

### Host-Based Firewall   
Protect individual hosts from being compromised when they're used in untrusted, potentially malicious environments.

- A host-based firewall plays a big part in reducing what's accessible to an outside attacker. 

- Bastion nhosts, or network 

- If the users have system have a administrators rights, then they have the ability to change firewall rules and configurations.

### Logging aand Auditing  
- Security informative adn event management systems

- Normalization 

- Once logs are centralized and standardized, you can write automated alerting based on rules. 

- ryslog 
- Splunk Enterprise security 
- IBM Security Qradar 
- RSA security Analytics  

### Antimalware Protection 
Lots of unprotected systems would be sompromised in a matter of minutes if directly connected to the internet without any safeguards or protections in place. 

- Antivirus software will monitor and analyze things, like new files being created or being modified on the system, in order to watch for any bbehavior thayt matches a kn own malware signatures

- It protects against the most common attacks out there on the internet. 

- Antivirus software is just one piece of our anti-malware defences.  

- Binary whistelisting software  

### Disk Encyption 
- Full-disk encryption(FDE)  
Works by automatically converting data on a hard drive into a form that cannot be understood by anyone who doesn't have the key to "undo" the conversion  

- Secure Boot Protocol 
- Platform key 

- input -> Encryptrion Algorithm -> Decryption Algorithm -> Output 

- When you implement a full disk encryption solution at scale, it's super important to think how to jandle cases where passwords are forgotten. 

- key Escrow  
Allows the encryption key to be securily stored for later retrival by an unathorized party. 

- home directory or file-based encryption only guarantees confidentiality and integrity of files protected by encryption 

### Software Patch Management 
- As an IT support specialist, it's critical that you make sure that you install software updated and security patches in a timely way, in order to defend your company's system and networks. 

- The best protection is to have a good system and policy in place for your company. 

- critical infrastruture devices should be approched carefully when you apply updates. there's always the risk that a software update will introduce a new bug that might affect the functionality of the device.  

### Application Policies 
- A common recommendation, or even requirements, is to only support or require the latest version of a pieces of software. 

- It's generally a good idea to disallow risky classes of software by policy. Things like file sharing software and piracy-related software tend to be closely associated with malware infections. 

- Undertanding what your users need to do their jobs will help shape your approach to software policies and guidelines. 

- Helping your users accomplish tasks by recommending or supporting specific software makes for more secure environment. 

- Extensions that require full access to web sites visited can be risky, since the extension developer has the power to modify pages visited.
