### Authentication Best Practices
- Authentication
- Authorization 
- Accounting 


- Identification  
The idea of describing an entity uniquely.  

- authn (for authentication)
- authz (for authorization)

- Risk mitigation  
- ILik3P0n1ez99

- Incorporating good password policies into an organization is key to ensuring that employees are securing their accounts with strong passwords.  

- Length requirements 
- Character complexity  
- Dictionary words  


### Multifactor Authentication  
A system where users are authenticated by presenting multiple pieces of information of objects  

- Something you know = Password/PIN 
- Something you have = ATM / Bank card 
- Something you are = Biometric ID 

- Physical tokens 
- OTP 
- TOTP 
- Time-based token
- Network time protocol(NTP) 
- Counter-based tokens  

- Biometric authentication  
The process of using unique physiological characteristics of an individual to identify them  

- Universla 2nd Factor  
- Security keys  

### certificates  
In order to issue client certificates, an organization must setup and maintain CA infrastructure to issue and sign certificates  

- Certificate revocation list (CRL)  
A signed list published by the CA which defines certificates that have been explicity revoked 

### LDAP 
- lightweight Directory Access protocol (LDAP)  
An open, industry-standard protocol for accessing and maintaining directory services  

- Data Information tree  
- organizational units (OUs) 
- Distinguished name 
- Bind  
- startTLS  
- Search  
- Add/delete/modify  
- Unbind  

### RADIUS  
- Remote Authentication Dial-In User service (RADIUS)  
A protocol that provides AAA services for users on a network  

- Extensible Authentication Protocol  

### Kerberos  
A network authentication protocol that users "tickets" to allow entities to prove their identity over potentially insecure channels to provide mutual authentication  

- Authentication server  
- Ticket Granting service 

### TACACS+ 
Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System plus 

- TACACS+ is primarily used for device administration, authentication, Authorization, and accounting  

### Single Sign-On (SSO)  
An authentication concept that allows users to authenticate once to be granted access to alot of different services and applications  

- OpenID  

### Authorization and Access Control Methods  
- Authorization  
Pertains to describing what the user account has access to, or doesn't have access to  

- OAuth  

### Access Control  
- OAuth  
An open standard that allows users to grant third-party websites and applications access to their information without sharing account credentials  

- OAuth permissions can be used in phishing-style attacks to gain access to accounts, without requiring credentials to be compromised 

### Access contro List (ACL)
A way of defining permissions or authorizationd for objects  

- Access Control entries 

### Tracking usage and Access
- Accounting  
Keeping records of what resources and services your users accessed, or what they did when they ere using your systems  

- Auditing  
- TACACS+ is a device access AAA system that manages who has access to your network devices and what they do on them.
