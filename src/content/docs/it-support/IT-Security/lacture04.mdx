### Security Goals
If your copmany handles credit card payments, then you have to follow the PCI DSS, or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard 

1. Build and maintain a secure network and systems  
2. Protect cardholder data  
3. maintain a vulnerability management program.  
4. implement strong access control measures.  
5. Regularly monitor and test networks.  
6. Maintain an information security policy.

### Measuring and Assessing Risk 
Security is all about determining risks or exposure; understanding the likelihood of attacks; and designing defenses around these risk to minimize the impact of an attack.  

- Security risk assessment starts with threat modeling.  
- High value data usually includes account information, like usernames and passwords. Typically, any kind of user data is considered high value, especially if payment processing is involved.  

- Vulnerability Scanner  
A computer program designed to access computers, computer systems, netwrk or applications for weaknesses

- Nessus 
- OpenVAS 
- Qualys 

- penetrating Testing  
The practice of attempting to break into a system or network to verify the systems in place.  

### Privacy Policy 
Privacy policy oversee the access and use of sensitive data  

- It's a good practice to apply the principle of least priviledge here, by not allowing access to this type of data by default 

- Any access that doesn't hace a corresponding request shoild be flagged as a high-priority potential breach that needs to be investigated as soon as possible 

- Data-handling policies should cover the details of how different data is classified.

- Once different data classes are denied, you should create guidelines around how to handle these different types of data.  

### User Habits  
You can build the world's best security systems, but they won't protect you if the users are going to be practicing unsafe security  

- You should never upload confidential information onto a third-party service that hasn't been evaluated by your company.  

- It's important to make sure employees use new and unqiue passwords, and don't reuse them from other services.  

- A much greater risk in the workplace that users should be educated on is credential theft from phishing emails.

- If someone entered their password into a phising site, or even suspects they did, it's important to change their password as soon as possible.

### Third-Party Security  
If you have subpar security, you're undermining your security defenses by potentially opening a new evenue of attack.  

- If you can, ask for a third-party security assessment report.  

- VASQ - Vendor security Assessment Questionaries 

### Security Training  
- Helping others keep security in mind will help decrease the security burderns you'll have an IT support Specialist.

- If not, you absolutely should be!  

- You also need yo justify why these are good behaviors to adopt.  

### Incident Reporting and Analysis 
- The very first step of handling an incident is to detect it in the first place  

- The next step is to analyze it and determine the effects and scope of damage  

- Once the scope of the incident is determined, the next step is containment  

- If an account was compromised, change the password immediately. If the owner is unable to change the password righjt away, then lock the account.  

- severity includes factors like what and how many systems were compromised, and how the breach affects business functions.  


- the impact of an incident is also an important issue to consider.  

- Data exfiltration 
The unathorization transfer of data from a computer  

- Recoverability  
How complicated and time-consuming the recovery effort will be  

### incident Response and Recovery 
- Update firewall rules and ACLs if an exposures was discovered in the course of the investigation 

- create new definitions and rules for intrusion detection systems that can watch for the signs of the same attack again.
