4. implement strong access control measures.  
5. Regularly monitor and test networks.  
6. Maintain an information security policy.

### Measuring and Assessing Risk 
Security is all about determining risks or exposure; understanding the likelihood of attacks; and designing defenses around these risk to minimize the impact of an attack.  

- Security risk assessment starts with threat modeling.  
- High value data usually includes account information, like usernames and passwords. Typically, any kind of user data is considered high value, especially if payment processing is involved.  

- Vulnerability Scanner  
A computer program designed to access computers, computer systems, netwrk or applications for weaknesses

- Nessus 
- OpenVAS 
- Qualys 

- penetrating Testing  
The practice of attempting to break into a system or network to verify the systems in place.  

### Privacy Policy 
Privacy policy oversee the access and use of sensitive data  

- It's a good practice to apply the principle of least priviledge here, by not allowing access to this type of data by default 

- Any access that doesn't hace a corresponding request shoild be flagged as a high-priority potential breach that needs to be investigated as soon as possible 

- Data-handling policies should cover the details of how different data is classified.

- Once different data classes are denied, you should create guidelines around how to handle these different types of data.  

### User Habits  
You can build the world's best security systems, but they won't protect you if the users are going to be practicing unsafe security  

- You should never upload confidential information onto a third-party service that hasn't been evaluated by your company.
