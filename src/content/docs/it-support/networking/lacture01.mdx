### Course Introduction
- Protocol 
A deifned set of standards tht computers must follow in order to comminicate properly.

- Computer Networking 
The name we've given to full scope of how computers comminicate with each other.

| #   | Layer Name   | Protocol             | Protocol Data Unit | Addressing     |
|-----|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 5   | Application  | HTTP, SMTP, etc.     | Messages            | n/a            |
| 4   | Transport    | TCP/UDP              | Segment             | Port #'s       |
| 3   | Network      | IP                   | Datagram            | IP address     |
| 2   | Data Link    | Ethernet, Wi-Fi      | Frames              | MAC Address    |
| 1   | Physical     | 10 Base T, 802.11    | Bits                | n/a            |

- OSI model 

### The TCP/IP Five-Layer Network 
- Physical Layer
Represents the Physical devices that interconnect computers 

- Data Link Layer
responsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals so network devices can comminicate 

- The Ethernet standards also defines a protocol responsible for getting data to nodes on same on the network or link. 

 - Network layer 
 Allows different network to comminicate with each other through devices known as routers.

 - Internetwork 
 A collection of networks connected together through routers, the most famous of these being the internet.

 - Internet - Network layer
 - IP is the heart of the internet and most smaller networks around the world. 

- Transport layer 
Sort out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data 

- UDP 

- Physical -> Data Link -> Network -> Transport -> Application 

### Cables 
- Cables 
Connect different devices to each other, allowing data to be transmitted over them 

- Copper 
- Fiber 

- The most common forms of copper twisted-pair cables used in networking are Cat5, Cat5e, and Cat6 cables. 

- Cat3 - cat5 - Cat5e - cat6 - Cat6a - Cat7

- crosstalk 
When an electrical pulse on one wire is accidently detected on another wire. 

- Fire cables 
Contain individual optical fibers, which are tiny tubes made out of glass about the width of a human hair 

- Copper cable - Fiber optic 

### hubs and Switches 
- Hub 
A physical layer device that allows for connections from many computers at once. 

- Sending to machine 3 -> Workstation 1 -> Hub -> Workstation 4, Workstation 2, Workstation 3 

- Collision domain 
A network segment where only one device can communicate at a time.

- If multiple systems try sending data at the same time, the electrical pulses sent acress the cable can interfere with each other. 

- Data Collision (Hub) -> Workstation 1 -> Hub -> Workstation 2, Workstation, Workstation, Workstation, Workstation 

- Network switch 

### Routers
- Hubs and Switches
The primary devices used to connect computers on a single network, usually referred to as a LAN, or local area netwrok. 

- Routers
A device that knows how to forward data between independent netwroks 

- Internet -> ISP -> Workstation -> Router -> Laptop 

- Border Gateway Protocol(BGP) 
Router share data with each other via this protocol, which lets them learn about the most optimal paths to forward traffic 

### Servers and Clients 
- servers 
- clients

- DNS server -> Mail server -> client 

### Moving Bits Across the Wire 
- Bit 
The smallest representation of data that a computer can understabd; it's a one ora zero 

- Modulation 
A way of varying the voltage of this charge moving across the cable 

- Line coding 
Sender -> Digital Data -> Encoder -> Digital Signal -> Decoder -> Digital Data -> Receiver

### Twisted Pair Cabling and Duplexing 
- Duplexing Communication 
The concept that information can flow in both directions across the tables 

- Simplex Communication 
This proess is unidirectional

- Client Computer -> Only sends(Simples) -> Server 
- Client Computer -> Simulataneous(Full-Duplex) -> Server 
- Client Computer -> Taken turns(Half-Duplex) -> Server 

### Networks Ports and Patch Panels 
- RJ45 Ports
- RJ45 Plugs 

- Network ports 

- Link LED - Cable properly connected to two devices that are both powered on - RJ45 Port 
- Activity LED - Would flash whhen data actively transmitted across the cable - RJ45 Port 

- Patch Panel

### Ethernet and MAC addresses
Ethernet as a protocol solved this problem by using a technique known as carrier sense multiple access with collision detection. 

- CSMA/Cd 
Used to determine when the communications channels are clear, and when a device is free to transmit data 

- Media Access Control Address(MAC)
A globally unique identifier attached to an individual network interface 

- It's a 48 bit number normally represented by six brouping of two hexadecimal numbers.

- Hexadecimal 
A way to represent numbers using 16 digits 

- Octet 
In computer networking, any number that can be represented by 8 bits 

- Organizationally Unique Indetifier(OUI)
The first three octects of a MAC address 



|                          | Organizational Unique Identifier | Vendor Assigned (NIC Cards, Interfaces) |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Size, in bits            | 24 Bits                          | 24 Bits                                 |
| Size in hex digits       | 6 Hex Digits                     | 6 Hex Digits                            |
| Example                  | 00 60 2F                         | 3A 07 BC                                |
| Structure                | Cisco                             | Particular Device                       |

- Ethernet uses MAC addresses to ensure that the data it sends has both an address for that sent the transmission, as well as the one the transmission was intended for. 

### Unicast, Multicast, and Broadcast 
- A unicast transmission is always meant for just one receiving address.

- If the least significant bit in the first octet af a destination address is set to zero, it means that ethernet frame is intended for only the destination address.


- If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to one, it means you're dealing with a multicats frame.

- Ethernet broadcats address 
FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF

### Disecting an Ethernet Frame
- Data Packet 
An all-ancompassing term that represents any single set of binary data being sent across a network link. 

- Ethernet Frame 
A highly structured collection of information presented in a specific order 

- Preamle 8 bytes - SFD 1 byte - Destination address 6 bytes - Source address 6 bytes - VLAN header 4 bytes - Ether-type 2 bytes - Payload 0-1500 bytes - FCS 4 bytes

- Preabmle 
8 bytes (or 64 bits) long, and can itself be split into two sections. 

- Start frame delimeter (SFD)
Signals to receiving device that the preamble is over and that the actual frame contents will now follow 

- Destination MAC address 
The hardware address of the intended recipient 

- Ether Tyoe field 
16 bits long and used to describe the protocols of the frame 

- If a VLAN header is present, the EtherType field follows it. 

- Virtual LAN(VLAN)
A technique that lets you have multiple logical LANs operating on the same physical equipment 

- Payload 
In networking in terms, i the actual data being transported, which is everything that isn't a header 

- Frame Check Sequence
A 4-byte or( 32-bit) number that represents a checksum value for the entire frame 

- The checksum value is calculated by performing what's known as a cyclical redundancy check against the frame. 

- cyclical redundancy Check(CRC)
An importanr concpet for data integrity, and is used all over computing, not just network transmissions
