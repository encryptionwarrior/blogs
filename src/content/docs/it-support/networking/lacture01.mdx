### Course Introduction
- Protocol 
A deifned set of standards tht computers must follow in order to comminicate properly.

- Computer Networking 
The name we've given to full scope of how computers comminicate with each other.

| #   | Layer Name   | Protocol             | Protocol Data Unit | Addressing     |
|-----|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 5   | Application  | HTTP, SMTP, etc.     | Messages            | n/a            |
| 4   | Transport    | TCP/UDP              | Segment             | Port #'s       |
| 3   | Network      | IP                   | Datagram            | IP address     |
| 2   | Data Link    | Ethernet, Wi-Fi      | Frames              | MAC Address    |
| 1   | Physical     | 10 Base T, 802.11    | Bits                | n/a            |

- OSI model 

### The TCP/IP Five-Layer Network 
- Physical Layer
Represents the Physical devices that interconnect computers 

- Data Link Layer
responsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals so network devices can comminicate 

- The Ethernet standards also defines a protocol responsible for getting data to nodes on same on the network or link. 

 - Network layer 
 Allows different network to comminicate with each other through devices known as routers.

 - Internetwork 
 A collection of networks connected together through routers, the most famous of these being the internet.

 - Internet - Network layer
 - IP is the heart of the internet and most smaller networks around the world. 

- Transport layer 
Sort out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data 

- UDP 

- Physical -> Data Link -> Network -> Transport -> Application 

### Cables 
- Cables 
Connect different devices to each other, allowing data to be transmitted over them 

- Copper 
- Fiber 

- The most common forms of copper twisted-pair cables used in networking are Cat5, Cat5e, and Cat6 cables. 

- Cat3 - cat5 - Cat5e - cat6 - Cat6a - Cat7

- crosstalk 
When an electrical pulse on one wire is accidently detected on another wire. 

- Fire cables 
Contain individual optical fibers, which are tiny tubes made out of glass about the width of a human hair 

- Copper cable - Fiber optic 

### hubs and Switches 
- Hub 
A physical layer device that allows for connections from many computers at once. 

- Sending to machine 3 -> Workstation 1 -> Hub -> Workstation 4, Workstation 2, Workstation 3 

- Collision domain 
A network segment where only one device can communicate at a time.

- If multiple systems try sending data at the same time, the electrical pulses sent acress the cable can interfere with each other. 

- Data Collision (Hub) -> Workstation 1 -> Hub -> Workstation 2, Workstation, Workstation, Workstation, Workstation 

- Network switch 

### Routers
- Hubs and Switches
The primary devices used to connect computers on a single network, usually referred to as a LAN, or local area netwrok. 

- Routers
A device that knows how to forward data between independent netwroks 

- Internet -> ISP -> Workstation -> Router -> Laptop 

- Border Gateway Protocol(BGP) 
Router share data with each other via this protocol, which lets them learn about the most optimal paths to forward traffic 

### Servers and Clients 
- servers 
- clients

- DNS server -> Mail server -> client 

### Moving Bits Across the Wire 
- Bit 
The smallest representation of data that a computer can understabd; it's a one ora zero 

- Modulation 
A way of varying the voltage of this charge moving across the cable 

- Line coding 
Sender -> Digital Data -> Encoder -> Digital Signal -> Decoder -> Digital Data -> Receiver

### Twisted Pair Cabling and Duplexing 
- Duplexing Communication 
The concept that information can flow in both directions across the tables 

- Simplex Communication 
This proess is unidirectional

- Client Computer -> Only sends(Simples) -> Server 
- Client Computer -> Simulataneous(Full-Duplex) -> Server 
- Client Computer -> Taken turns(Half-Duplex) -> Server 

### Networks Ports and Patch Panels 
- RJ45 Ports
- RJ45 Plugs 

- Network ports 

- Link LED - Cable properly connected to two devices that are both powered on - RJ45 Port 
- Activity LED - Would flash whhen data actively transmitted across the cable - RJ45 Port 

- Patch Panel
