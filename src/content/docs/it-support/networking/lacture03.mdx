### Introduction to the Transport and Application Layers

- Transport Layer 
Allows traffic to be directed to specific network applications

- Application Layer
Allows these applications to communicate in a wau they understand 

### The Transport Layer 
- Processes -> Multiplexer -> IP
- Processes -> Demultiplexer -> IP

- Port 
A 16-bit number that's used to direct traffic to specific services running on a networked computer 

- 10.1.1.100 
- 10.1.1.100:80 - Socket number or socket port 

- File Transfer Protocol
- Port 21 
- 10.1.1.100:21 

### Dissection of a TCP Segment 
- TCP Segment
Made up of a TCP header and a data section 

##### TCP Segment Header (20 Bytes)

| Bit Position | 0 - 15              | 16 - 31               |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **0**        | Source port (16)     | Destination port (16)  |
| **32**       | Sequence number (32)                          |
| **64**       | Acknowledgment number (32)                    |
| **96**       | Header Length (4)  | empty (6) | Control flags (6) | Window (16) |
| **128**      | Checksum (16)       | Urgent (16)            |
| **160**      | Options (0 or 16)   | Padding                |
| **192+**     | Data payload (varies)                         |


- Destination port  
The port of the service the traffic is intended for 

- Source port
A high-numbered port chosen from a special section oof ports known as ephemeral ports 

- Sequence number
A 32-bit number that's used to keep track of where in a Sequence of TCP segments this one is expected to be 

- Data offset field 
A 64-bit number that communicates how long the TCP header for this segment is 

- TCP Window 
Specifies the range of sequence numbers that might be sent before an acknowledgement is required

- TCP Checksum 
Operates just like the checksum fields at the IP and ethernet level 

- Urgent pointer field 
Used in conjunction with one of the TCP control flags to point out particular segments that might be more important than others 

- Options field 
It is sometimes used for more complicated flow control protocols 

### TCP Control Flags and the Three-way Handshake 
- URG(urgent)
A value of one here indicates that the segment is considered urgent and that the urgent pointer field has more data about this 

- ACK(acknowledged)
A value of one in this field means that the acknowledgement number field should be examined 

- PSH(push)
The transmitted device wants the receiving device to push currently-buffered data to the application on the receiving end as soon as possible

- RST(reset)
One of the sides in a TCP connection hasn't been able to properly recover from a series of missing or malformed segments.

- SYN(synchronize)
It's used when first establishing a TCP connection and makes sure the receiving end knoes to examine the sequence number field 

- FIN(finish)
When this flag is set to one, it means the transmitting computer doesn't have any more data to send and the connection can be closed 

- Three way Handshake
Computer A -> SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK -> Computer B 

- Handshake
A way for two devices to ensure that they're speaking the same protocol and will be able to understand each other 

- Four way Handshake
Computer A -> FIN, ACK,FIN, ACK -> Computer B 

### TCP Socket States 
- Socket 
The instantiation of an end-point in a potential TCP connection 

- Listen 
A TCP socket is ready and listening for incoming connections

- SYN_SENT 
A synchronization request has been sent, but the connection hasn't been established yet 

- SYN_RECEIVED 
A socket previusously in a LISTEN state has received a synchronization and sent a SYN/ACN back

- ESTABLISHED 
The TCP connection is in working order and both sides are free to send each other data 

- FIN_WAIT 
A FIN has been sent, but the corresponding ACK from the other end hasn't been received yet

- CLOSE_WAIT 
The connection has been closed at the TCP layer, but that the application that  opened the socket hasn't released its hold on the socket yet 

- CLOSED 
The connection has been fully terminated and that no further communication is and that no further communication is possible 

### Coonection-oriented and Connectionless Protocols
- Connectionless Protocols
Established a connection, and uses this to ensure that all data has been properly transmitted 

- User datagram Protocol

### Firewalls
A device that blocks traffic that meets certain criteria

### The Appllication Layer 
- payload 
- Chrome
- Internet Explorer 
- Safari

- Microsoft IIS 
- Apache 
- nginx 

- HTTP 
- FTP 

### The Application Layer and the OSI  model
- Open Systems Interconnection 

- Session layer 
Facilitating the communication between actual applications and the transport layer 
- Takes appllication layer data and hands it off to the presentation layer 

- Presentation Layer 
Responsible for making sure that the unencapsulated application layer data is able to understood by the application in question
