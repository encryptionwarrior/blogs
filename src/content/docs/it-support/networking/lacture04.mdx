### Introduction to Network Services
### Why do we need DNS?
- IP Address(32 bit binary number) - 10.10.1.1

- MAC Address(48 bit binary number) 00 0a 95 9d 68 16
- Domain Name System (DNS)
A global and highly distributed network services that resolved strings of letters into IP addresses for you 

- Domain Name
The term we use for something that can be resolved by DNS 


### The many steps of Name resolution
- IP Address 
- Subnet Mask 
- Gateway for a host 
- DNS server 

- There are five primary types of DNS servers:
1. Caching name servers 
2. Recursive name servers
3. Root name servers
4. TLD name servers
5. Authoratative name servers

- Caching and recursive name servers 
Purpose is to store known domain name lookups for a certain amount of time 

- Recursive name servers 
Performs full DNS resolution requests 

- Time to live(TTL)
A value, in seconds that can be configured by the owner of a domain name for how long a name server is allowed to cache an entry before it should discard it and perform a full resolution again
- user - caching/recursive name server - 13 root servers 

- Anycast 
A technique that's used to route traffic to different destinations depending on factors like location, congestion, or link health 

### DNS and UDP 
- UDP isconnectionless

### Resource Record types
- A record 
Used to point a certain domain name at a certain IPv4 IP address 

- DNS round robin 

- www.microsoft.com 
- 10.1.1.1
- 10.1.1.2
- 10.1.1.3
- 10.1.1.4

- Quad A record (AAAA)
very similar to an A record, except that it returns an IPv6 address instead of an IPv4 address

- CNAME record 
used to redirect traffic from one domain to another 
- microsoft.com 

- Cannonical Name
- By setting up a CNAME that points microsoft.com at www.microsoft.com, you'd only have to change the A record for www.microsoft.com 

- Mail exchange (MX)
This resource record is used in order to deliver email to the correct server 

- Service record(SRV)
Used to define the location of various specific services 

- Text record(TXT)
Originally intended to be used only for associating some descriptive text with a domain name for human consumption 

### Anatomy of a Domain Name 
- Top level dommain(TLD)
The last part of a domain name

- the internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers 

- Domains
Used to demarcate where control moves from a TLd name server to an authorative name server

- Fully qualified domain name(FQDN)
When you combine all of these parts together, you have what's known as this 

- host.sub.sub.subdomain.domain.com 

- DNS can techniqually support up to 127 levels of domain in total for a single fully qualified domain name

## DNS zones 
Allow for easier control over multiple levels of a domain 

- Zone files 
Simple configuration files that declare all resource record for a particular zone 

- Start of Authority (SOA)
Declare the zone and the name of the name server thaat is authorative for it 

- NS records 
indicates other name servers that might also be responsible for this zone 

- reverse lookup zone files 
These let DNS resolvers ask for an IP and get the FQDN assocaited with it returned 

- Pointer resource record (PTR)
Resolved as IP to a name
