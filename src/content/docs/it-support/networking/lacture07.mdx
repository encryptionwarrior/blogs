- Error detection  
The ability for a protocol pr program to determine that something went wrong 

- Error-recovery  
The ability for a protocol or program to attempt to fix it 

- Errors still pop-up 
- miscounfiguring occur 
- Hardware breaks down 
- System incompatibilities come to light 

- The cloud 
- IPv6 

### Ping: Internet Control Message Protocol 

- The payload of ran ICMP packet exists entirely so that the recipient of the message knows which of their transmission caused the error being reported 

- Ping  
Ping lets you send a special type of ICMP message called an Echo Request 

- If the destination is up and running and able to communicate on the network, it'll send back an ICMP Echo Reply message type 

### Traceroute 
A utility that lets you discover the path between two nodes, and gives you information about each hop along the way 

- TTL field 
- Time Exceeded 
- `traceroute google.com`
- `tracert google.com`

- mtr - Linux/MacOS
- pathping - Windows

### Testing Port Connectivity 
- netcat - Linux/MacOS 
- Test-NetConnection - Windows 
- nc, nc host, nc host port 
- Zero input/Output mode 
- Verbose 
- `nc -z -v google.com 80`
- `test-NetConnection google.com`
- -port

### Name Resolution Tools 
- nslookup 
- `nslookup twitter.com`
- set debug 

### Public DNS Servers 
An ISP almost always gives you access to a recursive name server as part of the service it provides.

- DNS as A Service 

- Public DNS Servers  
Name servers specifically set up so that anyone can use then, for free 

- Level 3 Communications 
- Most public DNS servers are available through anycast
