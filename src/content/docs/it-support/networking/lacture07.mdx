- Error detection  
The ability for a protocol pr program to determine that something went wrong 

- Error-recovery  
The ability for a protocol or program to attempt to fix it 

- Errors still pop-up 
- miscounfiguring occur 
- Hardware breaks down 
- System incompatibilities come to light 

- The cloud 
- IPv6 

### Ping: Internet Control Message Protocol 

- The payload of ran ICMP packet exists entirely so that the recipient of the message knows which of their transmission caused the error being reported 

- Ping  
Ping lets you send a special type of ICMP message called an Echo Request 

- If the destination is up and running and able to communicate on the network, it'll send back an ICMP Echo Reply message type 

### Traceroute 
A utility that lets you discover the path between two nodes, and gives you information about each hop along the way 

- TTL field 
- Time Exceeded 
- `traceroute google.com`
- `tracert google.com`

- mtr - Linux/MacOS
- pathping - Windows

### Testing Port Connectivity 
- netcat - Linux/MacOS 
- Test-NetConnection - Windows 
- nc, nc host, nc host port 
- Zero input/Output mode 
- Verbose 
- `nc -z -v google.com 80`
- `test-NetConnection google.com`
- -port

### Name Resolution Tools 
- nslookup 
- `nslookup twitter.com`
- set debug 

### Public DNS Servers 
An ISP almost always gives you access to a recursive name server as part of the service it provides.

- DNS as A Service 

- Public DNS Servers  
Name servers specifically set up so that anyone can use then, for free 

- Level 3 Communications 
- Most public DNS servers are available through anycast 

- Always make sure the name server is run by a reputable company, and try to use the name servers provided by your ISP outside of troubleshooting scenarios.

### DNS Registration and Expiration 
- Registrar  
An organization responsible for assigning individual domain names to other organizations or individual 

### Host Files 
The original way that numbered network addresses were correlated with words was through hosts files. 

- Hosts File  
A flat file that contains, on each line, a network address followed by the host name it can be referred to as 

- 1.2.3.4 webserver 
- Loopback address  
A way of sending network traffic to yourself 

- 127.0.0.1

- Almost every hosts file in existence will, in the very least, contain a line that reads 127.0.0.1 localhost, most likely followed by ::1 localhost, where ::1 is the loopback address for IPv6 

- Hosts files are a popular way for computer viruses to disrupt and redirect user's traffic. 

### What is The Cloud?
- Cloud Computing 
A technological approach where computing resources are provisioned in a shareable way, so that lots of users get what they need, when they need it 

- Hardware virtualization 
- Virtualization  
A single physical machine, called a host, could run many individual virtual instances, called guests 

- Hypervisor  
a piece of software that runs and manages virtual machines, while also offering these guests a virtual operating platform that's indistinguishable from actual hardware 

- Public Cloud 
A large cluster of machines run by another company 

- Private cloud  
Used by a single large corporation and generally hosted on its own premises 

- Hybrid Cloud  
A term used to describe situations where companies might run things like their most sensitive proprietary yechnologies on a private cloud, while entrusting their less-sensitive servers to a public-cloud 

- Cloud Computing  
A new model in computing where large clusters of machines let us use the total resources available in a better way 

### Everything as a service 
- X as a service 
- Infrastructure as a service(IaaS) 
You shouldn't have to worry about building youe own network of your own server 

- PaaS
- SaaS

- Platform as a Service(PaaS)
A subset of cloud computing where a platform is provided for customers to run their services 

- software as a Service(SaaS)
A way of licensing the use of software to others while keeping that software centrally hosted and managed 

- Gmail for Business 
- Office 365 Outlook 

### Cloud Storage 
- Cloud Storage System 
- Secure 
- Accessible 
- Available 

### IPv6 Addressing and Subnetting 
- IPv6 
- IPv5 was an experimental protocol that introduced the concept of connections 

- IPv6 = 32 bits 
- IPv6 = 128 bits 

- Undecillion 

- Multicast  
a way of addressing groups of hosts all at once 

- FF00:: multicast 
- FE80:: Link-local unicast 

- Link-local unicast addresses 
Allow for local network segment communications and are configured based upon upon  host's MAC address 

### IPv6 Headers 
- Version field   
A 4-bit field that defines what version of IP is in use

- Traffic Class field  
An 8-bit field that defined the type of traffic contained within the IP datagram, and allows for different classes of traffic to receivce different priorities 

- flow label field  
A 20-bit field that's used in routers to make decisions about the quality of service level for a specific datagram 

- payload length field  
A 16-bit field that defines how long the data payload section of the datagram is 

- Next header field 
A unque concept to IPv6, needs a little extra explanation 

- Hop limit field  
An 8-bit field that's identical in purpose to the TTL field in an IPv6 header  

### IPv6 and IPv4 Harmony 
- IPv4 mapped address space 
- IPv6 tunnels 
servers take incoming IPv6 traffic and encapsulate it within traditional IPv4 datagram 

- IPv6 tunnel broker 
Companies that provide IPv6 tunneling endpoints for you, so you don't have to introduce additional equipment to your network
