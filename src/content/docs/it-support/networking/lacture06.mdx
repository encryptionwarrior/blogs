### Introduction to Connecting to the Internet 
- Desktop, Laptop, Servers, Routers, Switches 

### Dial-up, Modems and Point-to-Point Protocols 
- PSTN (Public Switches telephone network)
- Plain old telephone service (POTS)

- USENET 

- A dial-up connection uses POTS for data transfer, and gets its name because the connection is established by actually dialing a phone number 

- Modulator/Demodulator 

- Baud rate  
A measurement of how many bits can be passed across a phone line in a second 
- 14.4 kbps 


### What is Broadbanding 
- Broadband  
Any connectivity technology that isn't dial-up internet

- T-carrier technologies  
originally invented by AT&T in order to transmit multiple phone calls over a single link 

- T-Carrier technologies
- DSL 
- Cable broadband 
- Fiber connections 

- Transmission System 1
 
### Digital Subscriber Lines 
- Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers 
- ADSL 
- SDSL 

- Asymetric Digital Subscriber Line
- Symmertic Digital Subscriber Line 
- High Bit-rate Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers 

### Cable Broadband 
- Cable Communications Policy Act 
- TV frequency
- Phone frequency
- Cable broadband 
- Shared bandwidth technology 

- Central office 

- Cable Modem  
The device that sits at the edge of a consumer's netwrok and connects it to the cable modem termination system, or CMTS 

- Cable Modem termination system(CMTS)  
Connects lots of different cable connections to an ISPs core network 


### Fiber Connections 
- FTTX (Fiber To THe X)
- Fiber To The Neighborhood(FTTN)
- Fiber To The Building (FTTB)

- FTTB is a setup where fiber techonogies are used for data delivery to an individual building.

- FTTH(Fiber To The Home)
- FTTP (Fiber To The Premises)

- Optical Network terminator(ONT)  
Converts data from protocols the fiber network can understand, to those that more traditional, twisted-pair copper netwroks can understand

### Wide Area Netwrok technologies
- Wide Area Networks (WAN)  
Acts like a single network, but spans across multiple physical locations

### Point-to-POint VPNs 
- Site-to_site VPN 

### Introduction to wireless networking  Technolgies 
- Wireless networking  
A way to network without wires 

- IEEE 802.11 standards 
- 802.11 family 
- WiFi 

- Frequency band 
A certain section of the radio spectrum that's been agreed upon to be used for certain communications 

- In North America, FM radio transmissions operate between 88 and 108 MHz

- FM broadcast band 
- 2.4 Ghz and 5Ghz 

- 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac

- 802.11 = physical and data link layers 

- Frame control field 
Is 16 bits long and contains a number of subfields that are used to describe how the frame itself should be processed 

- Duration field 
It specifies how long the total frame is, so the receiver knows how long it should expext to have to listen to this transmission 

- Sequence control field 
Is 16 bit long and mainly contains a sequence number used to keep track of the ordering of frames 

- Data payload 
Has all the data of the protocols further up the stack 

- Frame check sequence field 
Contains a checksum used for a cyclical redundancy check, just like how ethernet does it 

### Wireless Network Configurations 
- Ad-hoc network 
- Wireless LANS(WLANS)
- Mesh networks 

- In ad-hoc network, there isn't really any supporting network infrastructure 

- WLAN

### Wireless Channels 
- Channels  
Individually, smaller sections of the overall frequency band used by a wireless network 

- Collision domain  
Any one network segment where one computer can interrupt another

- Avoid collision domains wherever you can 

### Wireless security 
- Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)  
An encryption technology that provides a very low of privacy 

- WiFi Protected Access 
- 128 bits 
- WPA2 
- 256 bits

- MAC filtering  
You configure your access points to only allow for connections from a specific set of MAC addresses belonging to devices you trust 

### Cellular Networking 
- Mobile Networking 

### Mobile Device Networking 
- Cellular networks 
- WiFi 
- Bluetooth 
- Internet of Things(Iot) network protocols 
- metered connections 
- Non-metered connections 
- Short-range wireless networks 
- Bluetooth
