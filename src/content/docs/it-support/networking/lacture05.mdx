- IP address
- Subnet mask 
- Gateway
- Name server 

- Dyanamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
An application layer protocol that automates the configuration process of hosts on a network 

- Dyanamic Allocation 
A range of IP addresses is set aside for client devices and one of these IPs is issued to these devices when they request one 

- Automatic Allocation
a range of IP addresses is set aside for assigment purposes 

- Fixed allocation 
Requires a manually specified list of MAC address and their corresponding IPs 

- Netwrok time protocol(NTP) servers 
Used to keep all computers on a network synchronized in time 


### DHCP in Action 
- DHCP discovery 
The process by which a client confihured to use DHCP attempts to get network configuration information

- DHCP lease 

### Basics of NAT 
- Netwrok Address Translation 
A technologies that allows a gateway, usually a router or firewall, to rwrite the source IP of an outgoing IP datagram while retaining the original Ip in order to rewrite it into the response 

- IP masquerading 
- One-to-many NAT 

### NAT and the Transport Layer 
- Port preservation
A technique where the source port chosen by a client is the same port used by the router 

- - Port Forwarding 
A technique where specific destination ports can be configured to always be delivered to speicific nodes 

### NAT, Non-Routable Address Space and the Limits of IPv4 
- Regionnal internet registries 
- AFRINIC serves the continent of Africa 
- ARIN serves the United States, Canada, and parts of the Caribbean 
- APNIC is responsible for most of Asia, Australia, New Zealand and Pecific Island nations 
- LACNIC covers central Central and South america and any parts of the Carribbean not covered by ARIN 
- RIPE serves Europe, Russia, the Middle East portions of Central Asia 

- The IANA assigned the last unallocated/8 network blocks to the various RORs on February 3, 2011 

- Then in April 2011, APNIC ran out of addresses 
- RIPE was exit, in september of 2012v

- LACNIC ran out of addresses to assign in June 2014, and ARIN did the same in September 2015 

- Only AFRINIC has some IPs letf, but those are predicted to be depleted by 2018 

- Non-routable address space 

- EFC1918 

- Virtual Private Netwroks (VPN)
A technology that allows for the extension of a private or local network to hosts that might not be on that local network 

- Remote Client -> VPN Tunnel(Internet) - > Router -> VPN server 

- Two-factor authentication
A technique where more than just a username and password are used to authenticate

- VPN server -> router -> VPN tunnel(Internet) -> Router -> VPN Server 

### Proxy Services 
A server that acts on behalf of a client in order to access another services

- Anonymity
- Security 
- Content filtering 
- Increased performance

- Web proxies 
 
- Reverse proxy
A service that might appear to be a single server to external clients, but actually represents many servers living behind it
