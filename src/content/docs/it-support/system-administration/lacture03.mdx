- Reverting to the previous state is called a rollback 

### Never test in Production 
- production  
The parts of the infrastruture where a certain service is executed and served to its users 

- Test enviroment  
A virtual machine running the same configuration environment, but isn't actually serving any users of the service 

- Secondary or stand-by machine  
This machine nwill be exactly the same as a production machine, but won't receive any traffic from actual users untill you enable it to do so 


- For even bigger services, when you have lots of mservers providing the service, you may want to have canaries.

### Assesing Risk 
- In general , the more users your service reaches, the more you'll want to ensure that changes aren't disruptive  

- The more important your service is to your comapny's operations, the more you'll work to keep the services up.  

### Fixing Things the right way?
- Reproduction case  
Creating a roadmap to retrace the steps that led the user to an enexpected outcome 

- What steps did you take to get to this points? 
- What's the unexpected or bad result?
- what's the expected result? 


- After applying your fix, retrace the same steps that took you to the bad experience. If your fix worked, the expected experience should now take place
