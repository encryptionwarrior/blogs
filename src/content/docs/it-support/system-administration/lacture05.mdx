### What is a Directory Server?
Contains a lookup service that provides mapping beyween network resources and their network addresses.

- Replication  
The stored directory data can be copied and distributed across a number of physically distributed servers, but still appear as one, unified datastore for querying and administrating  

-  Directory services  
Useful for organization data and making it searchable for an organization 

- Organizational Units (OUs)

- Setup 
- Configuration 
- maintenance 

### Implementing Directory server  
- Directory Access Protocol(DAP) 
- Directory System Protocol(DSP)
- Directory Information shadowing Protocol(DISP)
- Directory Operational Binding Management Protocol (DOP)
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol(LDAP)
- Active Directory (AD) 
- OpenLDAP

### What is Centralized Management?
A central service that provides instructions to all of the different parts of my IT infrastructure  

- Directory services provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting, also known as AAA.  

- RBAC (Role Based Access Control)

- Chef 
- Puppet 
- SCCM 


### What is LDAP?
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol(LDAP)  
Used to access information in directory services like over a network  

- Active Directory 
- OpenLDAP  

- dn:CN=Devan Sri-Tharan, OU=sysadmin, DC=example, DC=com 
- dn(distinguished name), CN=(Common name of the object), OU(Organization unit such as a group), DC(domain component)


### What is LDAP Authentication 
- Bind operation 
-  Anonymous 
- Simple 
- SASL (Simple Authentication & Security Layer)

- kerberos  
A network authentication protocol that's used to authenticate user identity, secure the transfer of user credentials, and more 

### What is Active Directory? (AD)
The native directory service for microsoft windows

- Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
- Active Directory Administrative Center(ADAC)
- Containers 
- Flexible Single-master Operations (FSMO) 

### Managing Active Directory 

### Managing Active Directory Users and Groups  
- Security Account Manager 
- Security Group  
- Distribution Group  
- Domain Local
- Global 
- Universal 
- Security principal 
- Parent group 

### Managing Active Directory User Passwords 
- One way cryptographic hash 
- If there's more than one person who can authenticate using same username and password, then auditing becomes difficult or even impossible 
- Reset 
- Enceryption File system(EFS)

### Joining an Active Directory Domain 
- Joined or bound 
- Workgroup computer 

- `Add-computer -DomainName 'example.com' -Server 'dcl'`
- Functional levels 

### What is Group Policy?  
- Group Policy Object  
A set of plocies and preferences that can be applied to a group of objects in the directory 

- When you link a GPO, all of yhe computers or users under that domain, site, or OU will have that policy applied. 

- WMI Filters 
- Securoty filtering 

- A group Policy object can conayin computer configuratiuon, user configuration, or both. 


- Policies  
Settings that are reapplied every few minutes, and aren't meant to be changed even by the local administrators 

- Group Policy Preferences  
Settings that, in many cases, are meant to be a template for settings  


- Windows Registry  
A hierarchiral database of settings that windows, and many windows applications, use for storing configuration data 

- Group policy Creation and Editing 
- Group Policy management Console 
- WMI 
- Group Policy Settings Reference
- Change management process  
- AGPM 


### Group Policy Inheritance and precedence 
- When a computer is processing the Group Policy Objects that apply to it, all of these policies will be applied in precedence rules.  

- Resultant set of Policy (RSOP) 
- RSOP report 

### Group Policy Troubleshooting 
One of the most common issues you might encounter is when a user isn't able to login to their computer, or isn't able to authenticate to the Active directory domain. 

- DNS records 
- SRV records 
- The SRV records that we're interested in are _ldap.tcp.dc._msdcs.DOMAIN.NAME, where DOMAIN.NAME is the DNS name of our main.  

- `Resolve-DNSName -Type -Name _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.example.com` 

- w32tm/resync 
- A common issue that you might have to troubleshoot is when a GPO-defined policy or preferences fails to apply to a computer.  

- Fast Logon Optimization 
- gpupdate/force 
- gpupdate/force/sync 

- Replication failure 
- `gpresult /R` 
- `gpresult /H FILENAME.html`
- gpresult /H test.html 
- WMI filter 


### Mobile Device Management(MDM) 
- Remote wipe  
A factory reste that yopu can trigger from your central MDM, rather than having to do it in person on the device 

- Enterprise mobility management (EMM) 

### What is OpenLDAP?
- openLDAP 
- LDIF 
- LDAP Data Interchange Format 

- `sudo apt-get install slapd ldap-utils` 
-  `sudo dpkg-reconfigure slapd` 

### Managing OpenLDAP 
- phpLADP admin 
- LDIF files 
- ladpadd  
Takes the input of an LDIF file and adds the context of the files 
- ldapmodify  
modifies an existing object 
- ldapdelete 
- ldapsearch
