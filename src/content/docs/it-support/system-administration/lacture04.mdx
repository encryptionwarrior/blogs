### Module Introduction


### What is Data Recovery? 
The process of trying bto restore data after an unexpected event that result in data loss or corruption. 

- When an unexptected event occurs, your main objective is top resume normal operations as soon as possible, while minimizing the disruption to business functions. 

- The best way to prepared for a data-loss event is to have a well-through-out disaster plan and procedure in place

- Disaster plans should involve making regular backups of any and all critical data that's necessary for your ongoing business process.  

- Post-mortem   
A post mortem is a way for you to docuement any problems you discovered along the way, and most importantly, the way you fixed them so you can make sure they don't happen again.

### Backing Up Your Data 
- backup system 
    - Email databases 
    - Sales databases 
    - Financial spreadsheets 
    - server configurations 
    - databases 

- cat pictures(not)

- Local storage  
    - Pros  
    data is physically nearby low bandwidth needs 

    - Cons  
    Data loss due to damage at location \ 
    Needs large amounts of bandwidth 


### Backup Solutions 
- Magnetic data Storage Tapes  
- rsync  
A file transfer utility that's designed to efficiently transfer and synchronize files between locations or computers 

- Time machine 
- Backup and Restore 

### Testing backups 
- Restoration procedures  
should be documented and accesible so that anyone with the rioght access can restore operations when needed  

- Disaster recovery testing  

### Types of Backup  
- Ways to perform regular backups 
- Full backup  
- Differential backup  
- Regular implmented backups

- It's good practice to perfoem infrequennt full backups, while also doing more frequent differential backups  

- File compression  

- Reduntant array of independent disks(RAID)  
a method of taking multiple physical disks and combining them into one large vital disk  


### User backups 
- Cloud storage 
    - Drpbox
    - Apple iCloud 
    - Google Drive  

### What's a Disaster Revocery plan?  
- Disaster recovery plan  
a collection of documented procedures and plans on how to react and handle and emergency or disaster scenario, from the operational perspective.  

- Precentive measures  
Any procedures or systems in place that will proactively minimize the impact of a disaster  

- Detection measures  
Meant to alert you and your team that has a disaster has occured that can impact operations  


- Enviromnetal sensors  
- Flood sensors  
- temp  and Humidity sensors
- Evaccuation Procedures  


- Corrective or recovery measures  
Those enacted after a disaster has occured  


- single point of failure  


### designing Disaster Recovery Plan  
- Risk assessment  
Allow you to prioritize certain aspects of the organizations that are more at risk if there's an unforeseen event  

- Designing a Disaster Recovery plan 
    - Perform Risk Assessment  
    - Determine Backup and recovery Systems  
    - Determine Detection & Alert Measures & Test measures
    - Determine recovery measures  

### what's a Post-Mortem?  
We create a post-portem after an incident, an outage, or some event when something goes wrong, or at the end of a project to analyze how it went.


### Writing a Post-mortem  
- Brief summary example 
    - What the incident was 
    - how long it lasted  
    - What the impact was  
    - How it was started  
- Dates, times, timezones  
- Deailed timeline 
- Root cause  
- What can be learnd ?

- Resolution and Recovery efforts 
- Action to Avoid Same Scenario
