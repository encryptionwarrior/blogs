### Module Introduction
- Software Services  
Services that emloyess use that allow them to do their job functions.

- Platform services 
Provide a platform for developers to code, build and manage software applications. 

### Configuraring Communication Services 
- Comminication services 
- Security services 
- User productivity services 

- Internet Chat Relay (IRC)
- Paid-for options 
- Open IM protocols 
- XMPP 
- Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol

### Configuring Email Services 
- devan@example.com 
- Remember that the A record is used for hostnames, but for email servers, we use MX for the main exchange record. 

- POP3
- IMAP 
- SMTP 

### Configuring User Productivity Services 
- When considering software licenses, it's important to review the term and agreements. 

### Configuring Security Services 
- Hyper Text Transfer protocol Secure(HTTPS)  
The secure version of HTTP, which makes sure the communication your we browser has with the website is secured through encryption 

- Transport Layer security 
- Secure Socket layer
- SSL 
- SSL v3.0 
- TLSv1.0 


### What Are File Services 

### Network File Storage 
- FAT32 
- Network File System(NFS)  
A protocol that enables files to be shared over a network 

- NFS Server 
- Samba 
- SMB 
- Network-attached storage (NAS)

### Mobile Synchronization 

### Configuring Print Services 

- Print Servers 
- CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System)

### Web Servers Revisited 
- Web servers  
Stores and servers content to clients through the Internet 

- `sudo apt-get install apache2 -y`
- 127.0.0.1 (localhost)

### What is s Database server?
- Databases  
Allow us to store, query, filter, and manage large amounts of data 

- MySQL 
- PostgresSQL 

- Database Administrators 

### Is the Website Down? 
- HTTP status codes
- HTTP response 

- HTTP status codes are codes or numbers that indicate some sort of error or info messages that occured when trying to access a web resource. 

- 404 Not Found  
A 404 error indicates that the URL you entered doesn't point to anything 

- HTTP status codes that start with 4xx indicate an issue on the client-side

- The other common HTTP status codes you might see start with 5xx. These errors indicate an issue on the server side.

- HTTP status codes tell us more than just errors. They can also tell us when our request is successful, which is denoted by the codes that begin with 2xx.

### Cloud Concepts 
- Solid state Drice(SSD)

- Software as a Service(SaaS)  
The software is already pre-configured and the user isn't deeply involved in the cloud configuration 

- Infrasture as a service(IaaS)  
You're hosting your own services in the cloud. You need to decide how you want the infrastruture to look, depending on what you want to run on ot  

- Regions  
a geographical location containing a number of data centers 

- zone 
- if one of them fails for some reason, the others are still available and services can be migrated without visibly affecting users. 

- Public 
- Private 
- Hybrid 

- Public cloud  
Cloud services provided to you by a third party 

- Private cloud  
When your company owns the services and the rest of your infrasture - whether on-site or in a remote data center 


- Hybrid Cloud  
A mixture of both public and private clouds 


### Typical Cloud Infrastrure Setup 
- Load Balancer  
Ensures that each VM receives a balanced number of queries  

- autoscaling  
It allows the service to increase or reduce capacity as needed, while the service owner only pays for the cost of the machines that are in use at any given time  

- Monitoring 
- Alerting 

### when and How to Choose cloud 
Most cloud providers offer free trials, so it's a good idea to test that out to see if they meet your needs, and to check how well your company's infrastructure integrates with the cloud provider's.
