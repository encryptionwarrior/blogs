            游누 code is executable, functionally correct, modular and readable

        </Steps>

    2. Problem Solving & Data Structures

        游누 Intent: to test your problem-solving skills based on how you approach the problem.

        游누 Expect: 1 to 3 problems on common data structures and algorithms

        游누 Most Common Data Structures: Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, HashMap, Tree, Graph and Heap

        游누 Most Common Algorithms: String Manipulation, Two Pointers, Searching, Sorting, Backtracking, Bit Manipulation    and Dynamic Programming

        #### PREPARATION: 

            游누 Ask questions to understand problems

            游누 Explain your solution approach with interaction

            游누 Design solutions, Think code Structures, and then start Explaination

            游누 Clarify the input constraints

            游누 Write a few test cases with both input and output including side cases, and dry run solution before and after coding

            游누 Resources: Prepare for the PS/DS round?

        游누 Intent: To discussing and solving a non-trivial design problem.  Systems Design and Object Oriented Design (OOD).

        游누 Expect: To solve a broad design problem like Design Twitter (System Design) or Design a Parking Lot (OOD).

        游누 To do: start with gathering all the specific requirements from the interviewer. Make the interview as interactive as possible.

        #### PREPARATION: 

    4. Team Fitment(60 MINUTES)

        - Read up about our values and what makes you a great fit for us
        - Be honest about your success and failures
        - Invest some time in preparing yourself for the interview
        - Be candid and help us understand you better

    </Steps>
</Steps>

#### TOPICS TO BRUSH UP ON BEFORE YOUR INTERVIEW:
- **Supervised learning**: Topics include linear regression, logistic regression, Naive Bayes,
support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosted trees, Bayesian models, evaluation metrics for classification and regression tasks

- **Programming Languages**: You should be familiar with any programming language,
preferably, a high level programming language like Java, C++, C#, Python, etc.

- **Coding**: Most of the interviews require you to be proficient in coding. You'll be
expected to code on your laptop during the machine coding round and on paper/whiteboard during the PS/DS round. To do well in these rounds, you should be extremely comfortable with coding. During the interview, you are supposed to write a bug-free code in a short time. It'd be a good idea to practice coding on online coding platforms before the
interview.

- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: The PS/DS round is centered around data structures
and algorithms, and that is something you should learn well. Try to understand the basic
concepts related to different data structures and algorithms. You should be able to solve
most of the questions that you will likely encounter during the interview if you work on
the basic concepts.

- **Design Patterns and Principle**: There are many ways to solve problems while creating
features/products, but the only solutions that are long-lived are the ones with a good
design. Good design is essential for the code to be extensible and maintainable. One of
the most widely accepted paradigms of programming is the object-oriented programming paradigm which also widely use. It would be a good idea to learn how
to write code in an object-oriented way. There are some widely known best design practices, also known as the Design Patterns and Principles which may help create better
solutions and perform well in the Machine Coding and the Object Oriented Design
rounds

- **System Architecture and its components**: The design round is centered around system
architecture, and having a thorough understanding of the basics may help you perform
well in the design round. You are expected to know about different types of data stores
and when to choose one over the other. You must be aware of how distributed systems
work and what are the different nuances in them.

Having a clear understanding of CAP theorem, scaling, cache and queue systems, and
knowing the basics of the Internet as well as OS topics are essential for the system
design round.

#### SOME TIPS FOR A SMOOTH INTERVIEW:
- Be prepared:  . Prepare well, understand what we do as a business, the position you are interviewing for, learn how your role will contribute in achieving our vision and brush up your basics as much as possible

- Pique our interest:  why you stand out from the rest.

- Think things through: to know how you approach a problem. Therefore, make sure you think through your answers

- Be authentic and candid
