// Function to validate if a given Binary Tree is a Binary Search Tree (BST).

    if(root == NULL) {
        return true;
    }

    // Check if the current node's data is within the allowed range [min, max].
    // If it violates the range, it's not a BST.
    if(root->data >= min && root->data <= max) {
        // Recursively validate the left subtree:
        // Its new max bound becomes root->data (all left nodes must be <= root->data).
        // Its min bound remains the same.
        bool leftIsValid = ValidateBST(root->left, min, root->data);

        // Recursively validate the right subtree:
        // Its new min bound becomes root->data (all right nodes must be >= root->data).
        // Its max bound remains the same.
        bool rightIsValid = ValidateBST(root->right, root->data, max);

        // The current subtree is a valid BST ONLY if both its left and right subtrees are valid.
        return (leftIsValid && rightIsValid);

int main() {

    cout << "Enter data to create BST (use -1 for NULL, this function builds a BST by default if BST.h is from previous example): ";
    // This takeinput function likely inserts data according to BST rules,
    // so the resulting tree should already be a BST if inputs are unique.
    // For general BST validation, you'd feed a potentially invalid binary tree.
    takeinput(root);

    cout << endl << "Level Order Traversal of the created tree : " << endl;

    // Validate the created tree, starting with the broadest possible range for the root.
    // INT_MIN and INT_MAX are from <limits> header.
    if(ValidateBST(root, INT_MIN, INT_MAX)) {
        cout << "YES ! It is a Binary Search Tree." << endl;

Example INPUT for tree creation:
(Assuming BST.h's takeinput builds a standard BST)
1. Valid BST Input:
   50 20 70 10 30 60 80 -1
   Output: YES ! It is a Binary Search Tree.

2. Invalid BST Input (This requires modifying buildTree/takeinput in BST.h
   to build an arbitrary binary tree, not strictly a BST. For example, if you
   manually create a tree like:
         50
        /  \
       70  20
   (i.e., 70 on left of 50, 20 on right of 50)
   Then ValidateBST(root, INT_MIN, INT_MAX) would return false.
   The provided `takeinput` builds a valid BST, so for `NO` output, one would
   need a custom tree builder that doesn't enforce BST rules during creation.
   However, if you input something like: `10 5 15 12 18 -1`
   Tree:
        10
       /  \
      5   15
         /  \
        12  18
   This is a valid BST.

   If you had a non-BST construction and built:
         10
        /  \
       20  5
   ValidateBST(root, INT_MIN, INT_MAX) for this would be:
   - ValidateBST(10, INT_MIN, INT_MAX)
     - 10 is in range.
     - Call left: ValidateBST(20, INT_MIN, 10) -> 20 is NOT <= 10. Returns false.
     - Result: false
   Output: NO ! It is not a Binary Search Tree.

### 1\. Binary Search Tree (BST) Properties Recap

  * A Binary Search Tree (BST) is defined by its ordering property:
      * For every node, all values in its **left subtree** must be **less than** its own data.
      * For every node, all values in its **right subtree** must be **greater than** its own data.
      * Both left and right subtrees must also recursively be BSTs.
  * **Crucial Point**: It's not just about immediate children; the property applies to *all* descendants in a subtree.

### 2\. Supporting Components (Briefly)

  * `Node` class: Defines the structure of a binary tree node (`data`, `left`, `right`).
  * `insertIntoBST`, `takeinput`, `levelOrderTraversal`: These functions (assumed to be in `BST.h`) are used to create and display the binary tree which will then be validated. Note that `takeinput` for `BST.h` would typically build a *valid* BST. For validation, one might pass an arbitrary binary tree (not necessarily built via `insertIntoBST`). However, this code uses `insertIntoBST` for creation, implying it's testing if the insertion process itself yields a BST. If you want to test *any* binary tree, `takeinput` should be generic, not BST-specific.

### 3\. `ValidateBST(Node* root, int min, int max)` Function (Recursive Validation)

  * **Purpose**: Determines if a given binary tree (or subtree) adheres to all BST properties.

  * **Core Idea**: The most robust way to validate a BST is to pass down a valid range (`min` and `max` boundaries) that each node's data *must* fall within. As we recurse, these bounds are tightened.

  * **Parameters**:

      * `Node* root`: The current node being checked.
      * `int min`: The minimum permissible value for any node in the current subtree. Values less than or equal to `min` are invalid.
      * `int max`: The maximum permissible value for any node in the current subtree. Values greater than or equal to `max` are invalid.

  * **Logic Flow**:

    1.  **Base Case**:
          * `if (root == NULL)`: An empty tree (or subtree) is always considered a valid BST. Return `true`.
    2.  **Current Node Check**:
          * `if (root->data >= min && root->data <= max)`:
              * Check if the `data` of the current `root` node lies within the allowed `min` and `max` range inherited from its ancestors.
              * If it violates this, the entire tree is not a BST. The `else` part (returning `false`) handles this.
          * **Recursive Calls (If current node is valid)**:
              * `bool left = ValidateBST(root->left, min, root->data);`
                  * Recursively validate the **left subtree**.
                  * The `min` bound for the left child remains the same as its parent's `min`.
                  * The `max` bound for the left child becomes `root->data`. This is crucial: all nodes in the left subtree *must* be strictly less than the current `root->data`. (Note: The code uses `<=` which means duplicates would be allowed on the left, but usually BSTs have strict `<` for left and `>` for right or a specific policy for equals. Given `insertIntoBST` puts duplicates on left, `<=` is consistent).
              * `bool right = ValidateBST(root->right, root->data, max);`
                  * Recursively validate the **right subtree**.
                  * The `min` bound for the right child becomes `root->data`. This is crucial: all nodes in the right subtree *must* be strictly greater than the current `root->data`.
                  * The `max` bound for the right child remains the same as its parent's `max`.
              * **Combine Results**: `return (left && right);`
                  * The current subtree is a valid BST only if both its left and right subtrees are also valid BSTs.
    3.  **Invalid Node**:
          * `return false;`: This line is reached if `root->data` violates the `min`/`max` bounds, meaning the BST property is broken at this node.

  * **Initial Call in `main`**:

      * `ValidateBST(root, INT_MIN, INT_MAX)`: The entire tree starts with the broadest possible range. `INT_MIN` and `INT_MAX` (from `<limits>`) are used as initial unbounded limits.

### 4\. Complexity Analysis for Validation

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`
      * Every node in the binary tree is visited exactly once.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(H)`
      * Due to the recursion call stack, where `H` is the height of the tree.
      * **Worst Case (Skewed Tree)**: `H = N`, leading to `O(N)` space.
      * **Best Case (Balanced Tree)**: `H = log N`, leading to `O(log N)` space.
