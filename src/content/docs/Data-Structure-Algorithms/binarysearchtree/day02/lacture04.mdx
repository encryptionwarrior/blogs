Example INPUT for tree creation:
50 20 70 10 30 60 80 -1

       /  \
      20  70
     / \  / \
    10 30 60 80

Reverse In-order traversal (descending sequence): 80, 70, 60, 50, 30, 20, 10

Example Scenarios:
1. Enter the value of K : 1
   Output: The 1th largest element is = 80

2. Enter the value of K : 4
   Output: The 4th largest element is = 50

3. Enter the value of K : 7
   Output: The 7th largest element is = 10

4. Enter the value of K : 8 (K is larger than total nodes)
   Output: Could not find the 8th largest element (K might be too large or tree empty).

### 1\. Binary Search Tree (BST) Recap

  * A Binary Search Tree (BST) has the property where for any node:
      * All values in its **left subtree** are **less than** its own data.
      * All values in its **right subtree** are **greater than** its own data.
  * **Key Insight**: While an *In-order traversal* gives elements in ascending order, a **Reverse In-order traversal** (visiting Right child, then Root, then Left child) will visit nodes in **descending order**. This is the core principle for finding the Kth largest element efficiently.

### 2\. Supporting Components (Briefly)

  * `Node` class: Defines the structure of a BST node (`data`, `left`, `right`).
  * `insertIntoBST`, `takeinput`, `levelOrderTraversal`: These functions (assumed to be in `BST.h`) are used to create and display the BST.

### 3\. `kthLargest(Node* root, int &index, int K)` Function (Recursive Reverse In-order Traversal)

  * **Purpose**: To find the Kth largest integer value in the Binary Search Tree.

  * **Core Idea**: Perform a Reverse In-order traversal (Right -\> Root -\> Left). As we visit nodes in decreasing order, we maintain a counter (`index`). When this counter reaches `K`, the current node's data is the Kth largest.

  * **Parameters**:

      * `Node* root`: The current node being processed in the traversal.
      * `int &index`: A **reference** to an integer counter. This is crucial as it allows the `index` to be updated globally across all recursive calls, tracking the order of visited nodes.
      * `int K`: The target position (1-indexed) of the largest element we are looking for.

  * **Logic Flow (Reverse In-order Traversal with Counter)**:

    1.  **Base Case**:
          * `if (root == NULL)`: If we've traversed past a leaf or the tree is empty, return -1 (or some other indicator for "not found yet").
    2.  **Traverse Right**:
          * `int rightResult = kthLargest(root->right, index, K);`
          * Recursively call `kthLargest` on the right subtree first. The largest elements are found on the right side of the tree.
          * `if (rightResult != -1)`: If the `Kth` largest element was found within the right subtree (indicated by `rightResult` not being -1), immediately return that `rightResult` up the call stack, as we've found our answer.
    3.  **Process Current Node (Root)**:
          * `index++;`: If the Kth element wasn't found in the right subtree, increment the `index` counter for the current `root` node. This node is the next largest in sequence.
          * `if (index == K)`: If the `index` now matches `K`, this `root->data` is the Kth largest element. Return `root->data`.
    4.  **Traverse Left**:
          * `return kthLargest(root->left, index, K);`
          * If the Kth element was not found in the right subtree and the current root wasn't the Kth, then it must be in the left subtree. Recursively call `kthLargest` on the left subtree.

### 4\. Complexity Analysis

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(H + K)` in the average case for a balanced tree, effectively `O(K)` if K is small. In the worst case (skewed tree or K is close to N), it's `O(N)`.
      * The algorithm performs a reverse in-order traversal, visiting nodes in decreasing order. It stops once the Kth element is found.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(H)`
      * Due to the recursion call stack, where `H` is the height of the tree.
      * **Worst Case (Skewed Tree)**: `H = N`, leading to `O(N)` space.
      * **Best Case (Balanced Tree)**: `H = log N`, leading to `O(log N)` space.
