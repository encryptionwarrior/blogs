Example INPUT for tree creation:
50 20 70 10 30 60 80 -1

Expected Tree Structure:
        50
       /  \
      20  70
     / \  / \
    10 30 60 80

In-order traversal (sorted sequence): 10, 20, 30, 50, 60, 70, 80

Example Scenarios:
1. Enter the value of K : 1
   Output: The 1th smallest element is = 10

2. Enter the value of K : 4
   Output: The 4th smallest element is = 50

3. Enter the value of K : 7
   Output: The 7th smallest element is = 80

4. Enter the value of K : 8 (K is larger than total nodes)
   Output: Could not find the 8th smallest element (K might be too large or tree empty).

### 1\. Binary Search Tree (BST) Recap

  * A Binary Search Tree (BST) maintains the property that for any node:
      * All values in its **left subtree** are **less than** its own data.
      * All values in its **right subtree** are **greater than** its own data.
  * **Key Insight**: An **In-order traversal** of a BST visits nodes in **ascending (sorted) order**. This property is fundamental to finding the Kth smallest element efficiently.

### 2\. Supporting Components (Briefly)

  * `Node` class: Defines the structure of a BST node (`data`, `left`, `right`).
  * `insertIntoBST`, `takeinput`, `levelOrderTraversal`: These functions (assumed to be in `BST.h`) are used to create and display the BST.

### 3\. `kthSmallest(Node* root, int &index, int K)` Function (Recursive In-order Traversal)

  * **Purpose**: To find the Kth smallest integer value in the Binary Search Tree.

  * **Core Idea**: Since an In-order traversal naturally produces elements in sorted order, we can perform an In-order traversal and simply keep a counter (`index`). When this counter reaches `K`, the current node's data is our answer.

  * **Parameters**:

      * `Node* root`: The current node being processed in the traversal.
      * `int &index`: A **reference** to an integer counter. This is crucial because `index` needs to be shared and updated across all recursive calls to keep a global count of visited nodes.
      * `int K`: The target position (1-indexed) of the smallest element we are looking for.

  * **Logic Flow (In-order Traversal with Counter)**:

    1.  **Base Case**:
          * `if (root == NULL)`: If we've traversed past a leaf node (or the tree is empty), there's no node here. Return -1 to indicate that the element hasn't been found yet in this path.
    2.  **Traverse Left**:
          * `int leftResult = kthSmallest(root->left, index, K);`
          * Recursively call `kthSmallest` on the left subtree. This ensures that smaller elements are processed first.
          * `if (leftResult != -1)`: If the `Kth` smallest element was found within the left subtree (indicated by `leftResult` not being -1), immediately return that `leftResult` up the call stack, as we've found our answer.
    3.  **Process Current Node (Root)**:
          * `index++;`: If the Kth element wasn't found in the left subtree, increment the `index` counter for the current `root` node.
          * `if (index == K)`: If the `index` now matches `K`, this `root->data` is the Kth smallest element. Return `root->data`.
    4.  **Traverse Right**:
          * `return kthSmallest(root->right, index, K);`
          * If the Kth element was not found in the left subtree and the current root wasn't the Kth, then it must be in the right subtree. Recursively call `kthSmallest` on the right subtree.

  * **Initial Call in `main`**:

      * `int index = 0;`: Initialize the counter to 0 before the first call.
      * `ans = kthSmallest(root, index, K);`: Start the traversal.

### 4\. Complexity Analysis

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(H + K)` in the average case for a balanced tree, effectively `O(K)` if K is small. In the worst case (skewed tree or K is close to N), it's `O(N)`.
      * The algorithm performs an in-order traversal, which visits nodes in increasing order. It stops once the Kth element is found.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(H)`
      * Due to the recursion call stack, where `H` is the height of the tree.
      * **Worst Case (Skewed Tree)**: `H = N`, leading to `O(N)` space.
      * **Best Case (Balanced Tree)**: `H = log N`, leading to `O(log N)` space.
