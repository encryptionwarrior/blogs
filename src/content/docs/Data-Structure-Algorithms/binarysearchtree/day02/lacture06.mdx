Example Input for tree creation:
14 12 28 8 4 10 9 11 19 32 18 17 22 21 24 39 -1

Expected Tree Structure (partial):
            14
           /  \
          12   28
         / \   /  \
        8  10 19   32
       /  / \ / \   \
      4  9  11 18 22 39
                 / \
                17 21
                     \
                      24

Example Scenarios:
1. Enter the two node values : 4 11
   Expected LCA: 10 (or 8 depending on exact structure) -> Actually 10, then 12, then 14.
   Path to 4: 14 -> 12 -> 8 -> 4
   Path to 11: 14 -> 12 -> 10 -> 11
   LCA is 12 (as 4 is left of 12, 11 is left of 12, but 10 is also left of 12)
   Let's trace LCAinBST(14, 4, 11):
     - 14: (4<14, 11<14) -> root = 12
     - 12: (4<12, 11<12) -> root = 8
     - 8: (4<8, 11>8) -> return 8.
   Output: Lowest Common Ancestor of 4 & 11 is : 8 (Correct, 8 is the split point for 4 and 11)

2. Enter the two node values : 17 24
   Expected LCA: 22
   Path to 17: 14 -> 28 -> 19 -> 18 -> 17
   Path to 24: 14 -> 28 -> 19 -> 22 -> 24
   LCA is 19.
   Let's trace LCAinBST(14, 17, 24):
     - 14: (17>14, 24>14) -> root = 28
     - 28: (17<28, 24<28) -> root = 19
     - 19: (17<19, 24>19) -> return 19.
   Output: Lowest Common Ancestor of 17 & 24 is : 19 (Correct)

3. Enter the two node values : 4 14
   Expected LCA: 14 (P is a descendant of Q, Q is a descendant of P is wrong logic here). Q (14) is ancestor of P (4). So LCA is 14.
   Let's trace LCAinBST(14, 4, 14):
     - 14: (4<14, 14>=14) -> return 14. (Because 4 is less than 14, but 14 is NOT less than 14).
   Output: Lowest Common Ancestor of 4 & 14 is : 14 (Correct)

### 1\. Binary Search Tree (BST) Recap

  * A Binary Search Tree (BST) follows a specific ordering:
      * Left child (and its subtree) values are **less than** the parent.
      * Right child (and its subtree) values are **greater than** the parent.
  * This ordering is fundamental for efficiently finding the LCA.

### 2\. Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) Definition

  * The **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** of two nodes `P` and `Q` in a tree is the deepest node that is an ancestor of both `P` and `Q`.
  * A node can be an ancestor of itself.

### 3\. Supporting Components (Briefly)

  * `Node` class: Defines the structure of a BST node (`data`, `left`, `right`).
  * `insertIntoBST`, `takeinput`, `levelOrderTraversal`: Functions (assumed in `BST.h`) to build and visualize the tree.
  * `searchNode(root, data)`: An assumed function (likely in `BST.h`) that takes the tree `root` and a `data` value, and returns a `Node*` pointer to the node containing that `data`. (Crucial for `main` to get `Node* P` and `Node* Q` from `d1` and `d2`).

### 4\. `LCAinBST(Node* root, Node* P, Node* Q)` Function (Iterative Approach)

  * **Purpose**: To find the LCA of two given nodes `P` and `Q` in a BST.

  * **Core Idea for BSTs**:

      * If both `P` and `Q` are smaller than the current `root`, the LCA must be in the `left` subtree.
      * If both `P` and `Q` are larger than the current `root`, the LCA must be in the `right` subtree.
      * If one is smaller and the other is larger (or one of them *is* the current `root`), then the current `root` is the LCA. This is because all nodes smaller than `root` are to its left, and all larger nodes are to its right. So, if `P` and `Q` "straddle" the `root`, or `root` itself is one of them, `root` is the meeting point (LCA).

  * **Logic Flow**:

    1.  Start a `while` loop that continues as long as `root` is not `NULL`.
    2.  **Condition 1: Both P and Q are smaller than current `root`**:
          * `if (root->data < P->data && root->data < Q->data)`:
          * This means `root` is too large to be the LCA (both `P` and `Q` are on its right). The LCA must be further down in the `right` subtree.
          * Move `root = root->right;`
    3.  **Condition 2: Both P and Q are larger than current `root`**:
          * `else if (root->data > P->data && root->data > Q->data)`:
          * This means `root` is too small to be the LCA (both `P` and `Q` are on its left). The LCA must be further down in the `left` subtree.
          * Move `root = root->left;`
    4.  **Condition 3: `root` is the LCA**:
          * `else`: This `else` block is executed when neither of the above conditions is true. This implies:
              * `P->data <= root->data <= Q->data` (or `Q->data <= root->data <= P->data`)
              * OR `root` is `P` itself
              * OR `root` is `Q` itself.
          * In any of these scenarios, the current `root` is the LCA. Return `root;`

  * **Recursive Way (Commented out in code)**: Follows the same logic but uses recursive calls instead of a `while` loop. The base case is `if(root == NULL) return NULL;`.

### 5\. Complexity Analysis

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(H)`
      * `H` is the height of the BST. In each step of the iteration, we move down one level of the tree towards the LCA.
      * **Best Case (Balanced BST)**: `H = log N`. So, `O(log N)`.
      * **Worst Case (Skewed BST/Linear Chain)**: `H = N`. So, `O(N)`.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` for the iterative approach, as it uses a constant amount of extra space. (For the recursive approach, it would be `O(H)` due to the call stack).
