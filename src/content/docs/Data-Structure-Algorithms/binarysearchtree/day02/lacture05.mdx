Example Input for tree creation (from problem description):
9 6 2 8 11 19 7 12 25 -1

Expected Tree Structure (approximate):
          9
         / \
        6   11
       / \   \
      2   8   19
         /   /  \
        7   12  25

Example Scenarios:
1. Enter key: 9 (Root node, 2 children)
   - Pred: max in left subtree (8)
   - Succ: min in right subtree (11)
   Output: Predecessor : 8, Successor   : 11

2. Enter key: 7 (Leaf node)
   - Pred: 6 (ancestor)
   - Succ: 8 (ancestor)
   Output: Predecessor : 6, Successor   : 8

3. Enter key: 2 (Leftmost node, no left subtree)
   - Pred: -1 (no smaller element)
   - Succ: 6 (ancestor)
   Output: Predecessor : -1, Successor   : 6

4. Enter key: 25 (Rightmost node, no right subtree)
   - Pred: 19 (ancestor)
   - Succ: -1 (no larger element)
   Output: Predecessor : 19, Successor   : -1

5. Enter key: 10 (Key not in tree, but between 9 and 11)
   - Pred: 9 (closest smaller)
   - Succ: 11 (closest larger)
   Output: Predecessor : 9, Successor   : 11
   (This depends on the corrected `while` loop, otherwise might crash)

### 1\. Binary Search Tree (BST) Recap

  * A Binary Search Tree (BST) maintains a specific ordering: for any node, all values in its **left subtree** are **less than** its data, and all values in its **right subtree** are **greater than** its data.

### 2\. Predecessor and Successor Definitions

For a given `key` in a BST:

  * **Predecessor**: The largest node value in the BST that is **smaller than** the `key`.

      * If the `key` node exists and has a **left subtree**, its predecessor is the **maximum value in its left subtree** (the rightmost node in the left subtree).
      * If the `key` node exists but has **no left subtree**, its predecessor is the closest ancestor that is smaller than it. This ancestor is found by looking at the path from the root to the `key` node: it's the last ancestor for which the `key` node (or its ancestors) was in the right subtree.

  * **Successor**: The smallest node value in the BST that is **larger than** the `key`.

      * If the `key` node exists and has a **right subtree**, its successor is the **minimum value in its right subtree** (the leftmost node in the right subtree).
      * If the `key` node exists but has **no right subtree**, its successor is the closest ancestor that is larger than it. This ancestor is found by looking at the path from the root to the `key` node: it's the last ancestor for which the `key` node (or its ancestors) was in the left subtree.

  * **Handling Key Not Found**: If the `key` itself is not present in the BST, the `pred` will be the greatest value less than `key` that *is* in the tree, and `succ` will be the smallest value greater than `key` that *is* in the tree. The algorithm often works correctly for this scenario too.

### 3\. `predecessorSuccessor(Node* root, int key)` Function

  * **Purpose**: To find both the in-order predecessor and in-order successor of a given `key` in the BST.

  * **Approach (Two-Phase Strategy):**

      * **Phase 1: Search for the `key` node and capture potential ancestors for `pred` and `succ`.**

        1.  Initialize `pred = -1` and `succ = -1`. These will store our candidates.
        2.  Traverse the tree using `KeyNode` pointer, starting from `root`.
        3.  While `KeyNode->data != key` (and assuming `KeyNode` is not `NULL`):
              * If `KeyNode->data > key`: The current `KeyNode->data` is greater than `key`. It's a candidate for the `successor`. Update `succ = KeyNode->data`, and move `KeyNode = KeyNode->left` to find a potentially smaller successor.
              * If `KeyNode->data < key`: The current `KeyNode->data` is smaller than `key`. It's a candidate for the `predecessor`. Update `pred = KeyNode->data`, and move `KeyNode = KeyNode->right` to find a potentially larger predecessor.
        4.  When the loop finishes, `KeyNode` points to the node containing `key`. At this point, `pred` and `succ` hold the closest ancestor values if the actual `key` node does not have a left/right subtree.

      * **Phase 2: Find actual `pred` and `succ` from the `KeyNode`'s subtrees.**

        1.  **Finding Predecessor**:
              * If `KeyNode->left` is not `NULL`: The actual predecessor is the largest element in the `KeyNode`'s left subtree. Traverse `leftTree = KeyNode->left` and keep moving `leftTree = leftTree->right` until `leftTree->right` is `NULL`. Set `pred = leftTree->data`.
        2.  **Finding Successor**:
              * If `KeyNode->right` is not `NULL`: The actual successor is the smallest element in the `KeyNode`'s right subtree. Traverse `rightTree = KeyNode->right` and keep moving `rightTree = rightTree->left` until `rightTree->left` is `NULL`. Set `succ = rightTree->data`.

  * **Return Value**: Returns a `std::pair<int, int>` where `.first` is `pred` and `.second` is `succ`.

  * **Important Note on Code's `while(KeyNode->data != key)`**: This loop implicitly assumes the `key` *will always be found* in the tree. If the `key` is not present, `KeyNode` would eventually become `NULL` (`KeyNode->left` or `KeyNode->right` becoming `NULL`), leading to a null pointer dereference (`KeyNode->data`) and a crash. A robust implementation would be `while(KeyNode != NULL && KeyNode->data != key)`.

### 4\. Complexity Analysis

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(H)`
      * `H` is the height of the BST. The initial search for the `key` takes `O(H)`. Finding the min/max in a subtree also takes `O(H)` in the worst case (skewed tree), but more precisely, `O(log N)` on average and `O(depth_of_node)` + `O(height_of_subtree)` after finding the node. Effectively, it's proportional to the height.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
      * This iterative approach uses a constant amount of extra space (a few pointers), making it very space-efficient. (A recursive approach would use `O(H)` for the call stack).
