### 1\. Binary Search Tree (BST) Recap

  * A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a hierarchical data structure where for every node:
      * All values in its **left subtree** are **less than** the node's data.
      * All values in its **right subtree** are **greater than** the node's data.
      * Both left and right subtrees are also BSTs.
  * This ordering property is what makes searching efficient.

### 2\. `Node` Class

  * The basic building block of the BST, containing `data`, `left` (child pointer), and `right` (child pointer).

### 3\. `insertIntoBST` and `takeinput` (Briefly)

  * `insertIntoBST`: A recursive function to add new data into the BST while maintaining its properties.
  * `takeinput`: A utility function that reads integer input from the user (`-1` to stop) to build the BST that will be searched.

### 4\. `SearchBST(Node* root, int key)` (Recursive Search)

  * **Purpose**: To determine if a specific `key` value exists within the BST.

  * **Core Idea**: The search process is highly efficient because, at each node, the BST property allows us to eliminate one half of the remaining tree (either the left or right subtree), similar to a binary search on a sorted array.

  * **Logic**:

    1.  **Base Case 1 (Key Not Found)**:
          * If `root` is `NULL`, it means we have traversed down an empty path or reached beyond a leaf node without finding the `key`. The `key` is not present in the tree. Return `false`.
    2.  **Base Case 2 (Key Found)**:
          * If `root->data` is equal to the `key`, we have found the target node. Return `true`.
    3.  **Recursive Step**:
          * **If `key` is greater than `root->data`**:
              * According to BST properties, if the `key` exists, it *must* be in the **right subtree**. So, recursively call `SearchBST` on `root->right`.
          * **If `key` is less than `root->data`**:
              * The `key` *must* be in the **left subtree**. So, recursively call `SearchBST` on `root->left`.

  * **Return Value**: Returns `true` if the `key` is found anywhere in the subtree rooted at `root`, `false` otherwise.

### 5\. Complexity Analysis for Search

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(H)`
      * `H` is the height of the BST. In each step, the search effectively moves down one level of the tree.
      * **Best Case (Balanced BST)**: `H = log N`. So, `O(log N)`. This is highly efficient.
      * **Worst Case (Skewed BST/Linear Chain)**: `H = N`. So, `O(N)`. This degenerates to linear search performance.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(H)`
      * Due to the recursion call stack.
