Example Input for building a general Binary Tree:
(A typical input for buildBinaryTree might be like level order)
Input: 50 40 70 30 45 60 80 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1

This input creates a tree structure:
          50
         /  \
        40   70
       / \   / \
      30 45 60 80

In this specific case, the entire tree IS a BST.
Left subtree of 50: (40, 30, 45) -> valid BST (max 45)
Right subtree of 50: (70, 60, 80) -> valid BST (min 60)
50 > 45 and 50 < 60. So, 50-rooted tree is a BST. Size = 7.
Output should be 7.

Another Example:
Input: 10 20 30 -1 -1 -1 -1
Tree:
   10
  /
 20
/
30
This is a skewed tree.
Subtree at 30: {30} is BST, size 1. answer = 1.
Subtree at 20: Left is {30}. 20 < 30. Not a BST if it expects left to be smaller.
                20 is root, left is 30, right is NULL.
                Max in left is 30. 20 > 30 is FALSE. So {20, 30} is NOT BST.
Subtree at 10: Not a BST.
The largest BST would be {30} or {20} if 20 was a root of a valid BST.
Output will be 1.

Corrected example for a tricky case:
Input: 60 40 80 30 50 70 90 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
Tree:
         60
        /  \
       40   80
      / \   / \
     30 50 70 90
This whole tree is a BST. Max BST size = 7.

Consider a tree that is NOT a BST, but contains one:
Input: 10 20 5 -1 -1 -1 -1
Tree:
   10
  /  \
 20   5

- Leaf 20: Info(20, 20, true, 1). answer = 1.
- Leaf 5: Info(5, 5, true, 1). answer = 1.
- Root 10:
    - left: Info(20, 20, true, 1) -> left->maxi = 20
    - right: Info(5, 5, true, 1) -> right->mini = 5
    - Check for 10: left.isBST=T, right.isBST=T.
        - root->data (10) > left->maxi (20) -> FALSE
        - So, 10-rooted tree is NOT a BST.
- Final answer remains 1 (from either {20} or {5}).

### 1\. Binary Tree vs. BST

  * **Binary Tree**: A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. No specific ordering property is guaranteed.
  * **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A specialized binary tree where for every node, all values in its left subtree are smaller than the node's data, and all values in its right subtree are larger than the node's data.

### 2\. The Problem: Largest BST Subtree

  * Given a general Binary Tree (which may or may not satisfy BST properties), find the largest subtree (in terms of number of nodes) that *is* a valid BST.

### 3\. Approach: Post-order Traversal with Information Passing

  * This problem is effectively solved by a **post-order traversal** (`Left -> Right -> Root`).
  * For each node in the tree, we need to determine:
    1.  Whether its subtree *is* a BST.
    2.  If it is a BST, what are the minimum and maximum values within that BST subtree?
    3.  If it is a BST, what is its size (number of nodes)?
  * This information is passed *up* from children to their parent, allowing the parent to make a decision about its own BST property. A global variable tracks the maximum BST size found so far.

### 4\. `Info` Class

  * **Purpose**: A custom class designed to bundle all the necessary information that each recursive call needs to return to its parent.
  * **Members**:
      * `maxi` (int): The maximum value found in the current subtree.
      * `mini` (int): The minimum value found in the current subtree.
      * `isBST` (bool): `true` if the current subtree rooted at `root` is a valid BST; `false` otherwise.
      * `size` (int): The number of nodes in the current subtree (relevant only if `isBST` is true for this subtree).
  * **Initialization for `NULL` node**: When a `NULL` child is encountered (base case), it represents an "empty BST" with a `size` of 0, `isBST` as `true`, `mini` as `INT_MAX` (so any value is greater than it), and `maxi` as `INT_MIN` (so any value is smaller than it). These extreme values allow correct comparisons for parent nodes.

### 5\. `MaxBST(Node* root, int &answer)` Function

  * **Purpose**: Recursively traverses the Binary Tree, processing subtrees in a post-order fashion to determine their BST properties and update the overall largest BST size.

  * **Parameters**:

      * `Node* root`: The current node being processed.
      * `int &answer`: A reference to an integer variable that will store the size of the largest BST found so far across the entire tree. Using a reference allows global updates.

  * **Logic Flow**:

    1.  **Base Case**:
          * `if(root == NULL)`: If we reach a null node, it signifies an empty subtree.
          * Return an `Info` object initialized for an empty BST (`mini = INT_MAX, maxi = INT_MIN, isBST = true, size = 0`).
    2.  **Recursive Calls**:
          * `Info* left = MaxBST(root->left, answer);`: Get information about the left subtree.
          * `Info* right = MaxBST(root->right, answer);`: Get information about the right subtree.
    3.  **Process Current Node (`currNode`)**:
          * Create a new `Info* currNode` to store results for the current `root`.
          * `currNode->size = left->size + right->size + 1;`: The size of the subtree rooted at `root` is the sum of its children's sizes plus itself. (This is the total size, not necessarily a BST size yet).
          * `currNode->maxi = max(root->data, right->maxi);`: The maximum value in the current subtree is `root->data` or the max from its right child.
          * `currNode->mini = min(root->data, left->mini);`: The minimum value in the current subtree is `root->data` or the min from its left child.
    4.  **Check BST Property for `currNode`'s Subtree**:
          * `if(left->isBST && right->isBST && (root->data > left->maxi) && (root->data < right->mini))`:
              * For the current subtree rooted at `root` to be a BST, all three conditions must be true:
                1.  Left subtree must itself be a BST (`left->isBST`).
                2.  Right subtree must itself be a BST (`right->isBST`).
                3.  `root->data` must be greater than the maximum value in its left subtree (`root->data > left->maxi`).
                4.  `root->data` must be less than the minimum value in its right subtree (`root->data < right->mini`).
          * If all conditions met, `currNode->isBST = true;` else `currNode->isBST = false;`.
    5.  **Update Global Answer**:
          * `if(currNode->isBST)`: If the current subtree *is* a valid BST, then its `size` is a candidate for the `answer`.
          * `answer = max(answer, currNode->size);`: Update `answer` if `currNode->size` is larger.
    6.  **Return `currNode`**: Pass the `Info` object for the current subtree up to its parent.

### 6\. Complexity Analysis

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`
      * Each node in the binary tree is visited exactly once. At each node, constant time operations (comparisons, max/min, object creation) are performed.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(H)`
      * `O(H)` for the recursion stack, where `H` is the height of the binary tree. In the worst case (a skewed tree), `H` can be `N`, leading to `O(N)` space.
      * `O(N)` for creating `Info` objects (one for each node). However, these are returned and typically fall out of scope, so the active memory at any time is `O(H)`. If not manually deleted, a memory leak would occur. For competitive programming, `new` without `delete` is common if the program ends.
