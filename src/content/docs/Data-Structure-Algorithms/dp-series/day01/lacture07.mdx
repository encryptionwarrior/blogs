// 1. Recursive Approach (Brute Force)
// Finds the maximum number of segments that can be cut from a rod of length 'n'.
// 'n': Current length of the rod to cut.
// 'x, y, z': Allowed segment lengths.
// Time Complexity: Exponential, O(3^N) in worst case.
// Space Complexity: O(N) due to recursion stack depth.
int cutSegmentsRec(int n, int x, int y, int z) {
    // Base Case 1: If current length 'n' is 0, we have successfully cut the rod. 0 more cuts needed.
    if(n == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    // Base Case 2: If current length 'n' is negative, it means we overshot the rod length.
    // This path is invalid/impossible. Return INT_MIN to signify impossibility.
    if(n < 0) {
        return INT_MIN;
    }

    // Try cutting with segment 'x'. Add 1 to the result of the subproblem.
    int cutx = cutSegmentsRec(n - x, x, y, z); // Recursive call for remaining length (n-x)
    if (cutx != INT_MIN) cutx += 1; // Only add 1 if the subproblem was possible

    // Try cutting with segment 'y'.
    int cuty = cutSegmentsRec(n - y, x, y, z);
    if (cuty != INT_MIN) cuty += 1;

    // Try cutting with segment 'z'.
    int cutz = cutSegmentsRec(n - z, x, y, z);
    if (cutz != INT_MIN) cutz += 1;

    // Return the maximum number of cuts among the three possibilities.
    // If all are INT_MIN, max will correctly return INT_MIN.
    return max({cutx, cuty, cutz}); // Using initializer list for max with 3 elements
}

// 2. Dynamic Programming - Top-Down Approach (Recursion + Memoization)
// Optimizes the recursive solution by storing computed results in 'dp' table.
// 'dp': Memoization table, dp[i] stores max cuts for length 'i'. Initialized with -1.
// Time Complexity: O(N) - Each state 'n' is computed once.
// Space Complexity: O(N) for 'dp' vector + O(N) for recursion stack = O(N) total.
int cutSegmentsMem(vector<int> &dp, int n, int x, int y, int z) {
    // Base Case 1: Length is 0, 0 cuts needed.
    if(n == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    // Base Case 2: Length is negative, impossible path.
    if(n < 0) {
        return INT_MIN;
    }

    // If the result for 'n' is already computed and stored, return it.

    // Store the computed maximum cuts for 'n' in the dp table before returning.
    return dp[n] = max({cutx, cuty, cutz});

        // If (i - x) is a valid length AND (i - x) was reachable (dp[i-x] is not INT_MIN),
        // then we can potentially update dp[i].

            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - x] + 1);

    }

### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Given a rod of length `n` and three allowed segment lengths `x`, `y`, and `z`, find the maximum number of segments that can be cut from the rod.
  * **Constraint**: The total length of the cut segments must exactly equal `n`. You can use any of the segment lengths `x`, `y`, or `z` any number of times.
  * **Output**: The maximum number of segments. If it's impossible to cut the rod into segments of the given lengths such that their sum is exactly `n`, typically return `0` (or an indicator that it's impossible, like `INT_MIN` in intermediate steps).

### 2\. Problem Insight (Dynamic Programming)

This is an optimization problem where we want to maximize the number of segments. It's similar to the Coin Change problem (minimum coins), but instead of minimizing coins to reach a target sum, we are maximizing the count of segments.

The core idea is: to find the maximum segments for a length `i`, we can try making the last cut using length `x`, `y`, or `z`.
If the last cut was `x`, the remaining length was `i-x`, and we add 1 to the segments for `i-x`.
Similarly for `y` and `z`. We take the maximum among these valid options.

**Recurrence Relation**:
Let `dp[i]` be the maximum number of segments that can be cut from a rod of length `i`.

`dp[i] = 1 + max(dp[i-x], dp[i-y], dp[i-z])` (if `i-x, i-y, i-z` are valid lengths)

**Base Cases**:

  * `dp[0] = 0` (0 segments for a rod of length 0).
  * `dp[i] = INT_MIN` (or a very small negative number) if length `i` cannot be formed by the segments, or if `i < 0`. This is crucial to propagate "impossibility" correctly. If `dp[i-x]` is `INT_MIN`, then `INT_MIN + 1` should still indicate impossibility for `dp[i]`.

### 3\. Approaches to Solving

#### A. Recursive Approach (Brute Force)

  * **Idea**: Directly implement the recurrence relation using recursion.
  * **`cutSegmentsRec(n, x, y, z)`**:
      * **Base Case 1**: `if (n == 0) return 0;` (Reached target length, 0 remaining length, 0 more cuts needed).
      * **Base Case 2**: `if (n < 0) return INT_MIN;` (Overshot the length, this path is invalid, signifies impossibility).
      * Calculate `cutx = cutSegmentsRec(n-x, x, y, z) + 1;`
      * Calculate `cuty = cutSegmentsRec(n-y, x, y, z) + 1;`
      * Calculate `cutz = cutSegmentsRec(n-z, x, y, z) + 1;`
      * Return `max(cutx, max(cuty, cutz));`
  * **Important Note**: When adding `+1` to `INT_MIN`, it can wrap around to a large positive number if `INT_MIN` is the smallest possible integer. It's safer to check `if (ans_from_subproblem != INT_MIN)` before `ans_from_subproblem + 1`. Your recursive code doesn't explicitly check this, which could lead to issues.
  * **Pros**: Simple and direct translation.
  * **Cons**: Highly inefficient due to **redundant calculations** (overlapping subproblems).
  * **Time Complexity**: Exponential, roughly $O(3^N)$ in worst case.
  * **Space Complexity**: $O(N)$ (Due to recursion stack depth).

#### B. Dynamic Programming - Top-Down (Memoization)

  * **Idea**: Optimize the recursive approach by storing the results of already computed subproblems in a `dp` table.
  * **`cutSegmentsMem(dp, n, x, y, z)`**:
      * Same base cases as recursion.
      * Memoization check: `if (dp[n] != -1) return dp[n];` (assuming -1 means not computed).
      * Follow the recursive logic. **Crucially, after computing `cutx`, `cuty`, `cutz`, you need to check if they are `INT_MIN` before adding `1` and taking the max.** A safer way is to check `if (sub_result != INT_MIN)` for each `cutx`, `cuty`, `cutz` before comparing them in `max()`.
          * `int res_x = INT_MIN, res_y = INT_MIN, res_z = INT_MIN;`
          * `if (n - x >= 0 && dp[n-x] != INT_MIN) res_x = cutSegmentsMem(dp, n-x, ...) + 1;`
          * Similarly for `y` and `z`.
          * `dp[n] = max({res_x, res_y, res_z});` (Using initializer list for max for 3 elements)
      * Store `dp[n]` before returning.
  * **Pros**: Overcomes redundant calculations.
  * **Cons**: Still uses a recursion stack.
  * **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$ (Each state `dp[i]` is computed once).
  * **Space Complexity**: $O(N)$ (For `dp` array) + $O(N)$ (For recursion stack) = $O(N)$.

#### C. Dynamic Programming - Bottom-Up (Tabulation)

  * **Idea**: Build the solution iteratively from the base cases upwards. This is often the most robust approach for this problem type.
  * **`cutSegmentsTab(n, x, y, z)`**:
      * Create `vector<int> dp(n + 1, INT_MIN);` Initialize with `INT_MIN` to signify "unreachable".
      * Set `dp[0] = 0;` (0 segments for length 0).
      * Outer loop `for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)`: Iterate through all rod lengths from 1 to `n`.
      * Inside the loop, check each segment length:
          * `if (i - x >= 0 && dp[i - x] != INT_MIN)`: If previous length `i-x` is valid and reachable, update `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - x] + 1);`
          * Do similarly for `y` and `z`.
      * **Final Result Handling**: If `dp[n]` is still `INT_MIN` after the loop, it means `n` cannot be perfectly cut. In this case, return `0` as per common problem statements (or `-1` if specified). Otherwise, return `dp[n]`. Your provided `cutSegmentsTab` function correctly implements this.
  * **Pros**: No recursion stack overhead. Efficient and robust.
  * **Cons**: Requires an array of size `n + 1`.
  * **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$ (Outer loop) \* $O(1)$ (constant number of choices, 3 segments) = $O(N)$.
  * **Space Complexity**: $O(N)$ (For `dp` array).

#### D. Space Optimization

  * For this problem, `dp[i]` depends on `dp[i-x]`, `dp[i-y]`, `dp[i-z]`. Since `x, y, z` can be arbitrary values, we generally cannot reduce the space complexity to `O(1)` as `dp[i]` might depend on elements far back in the `dp` array. Thus, `O(N)` space is usually required for tabulation.

### 4\. Important Considerations

  * **`INT_MIN` vs. `INT_MAX`**: Use `INT_MIN` for "impossibility" when maximizing, and `INT_MAX` for "impossibility" when minimizing.
  * **`INT_MIN + 1`**: Be cautious about integer overflow. Always check if the value you are adding `1` to is `INT_MIN` before performing the addition. `INT_MIN + 1` might lead to a positive number, which would incorrectly be picked as a maximum.
  * **Return 0 for Impossible**: If `dp[n]` ends up as `INT_MIN`, it means the target length `n` cannot be perfectly formed. The problem usually expects `0` or `-1` in this case.
