```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> // Includes common standard libraries like iostream, vector, algorithm (for min).
using namespace std;     // Use the standard namespace.

// 1. Recursive Approach (Brute Force)
// Calculates the minimum cost to reach stair 'i'.
// Time Complexity: O(2^N) - Exponential, due to repeated calculations.
// Space Complexity: O(N) - Due to recursion stack depth.
// 'stairs': Vector containing costs for each stair.
// 'i': Current stair index being considered.
int minCostRec(vector<int> &stairs, int i) { // Renamed for clarity in main
    // Base Case 1: If index is less than 0, it means we are before the stairs. Cost is 0.
    if(i < 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    // Base Case 2: If index is 0 or 1, the cost to reach this stair is just its own cost.
    // (Since we can start from 0 or 1, and assume we've "arrived" there).
    if(i <= 1) {
        return stairs[i];
    }

    // Recursive step: To reach stair 'i', we can come from (i-1) or (i-2).
    // The cost is stairs[i] + minimum cost to reach either (i-1) or (i-2).
    int cost_from_prev1 = minCostRec(stairs, i-1); // Cost if we came from stair (i-1)
    int cost_from_prev2 = minCostRec(stairs, i-2); // Cost if we came from stair (i-2)

    return stairs[i] + min(cost_from_prev1, cost_from_prev2);
}

// 2. Dynamic Programming - Top-Down Approach (Recursion + Memoization)
// Optimizes the recursive solution by storing computed results in 'dp' table.
// Time Complexity: O(N) - Each subproblem is computed once.
// Space Complexity: O(N) for 'dp' vector + O(N) for recursion stack = O(N) total.
// 'stairs': Vector containing costs.
// 'i': Current stair index.
// 'dp': Memoization table, initialized with 0 (or -1) indicating not computed.
int minCostMemo(vector<int> &stairs, int i, vector<int> &dp) { // Renamed for clarity
    if(i < 0) { // Base Case 1
        return 0;
    }
    if(i <= 1) { // Base Case 2
        return stairs[i];
    }

    // If the result for 'i' is already computed, return it from dp table.
    if(dp[i] != 0) return dp[i]; // Assuming 0 is not a valid cost, or use -1.

    // Compute the result and store it in dp table before returning.
    dp[i] = stairs[i] + min(minCostMemo(stairs, i-1, dp), minCostMemo(stairs, i-2, dp));

    return dp[i];
}

// 3. Dynamic Programming - Bottom-Up Approach (Tabulation)
// Builds the solution iteratively from base cases up to 'n-1'.
// Time Complexity: O(N) - Single loop.
// Space Complexity: O(N) - For the 'dp' vector.
// 'stairs': Vector containing costs.

    int n = stairs.size();

    // Handle edge cases for n (number of stairs)
    if (n == 0) return 0; // No stairs, no cost.
    if (n == 1) return stairs[0]; // Only one stair, cost is just that stair's cost.

    // Create a dp table of size 'n'. dp[i] will store the minimum cost to reach stair 'i' (and pay its cost).
    vector<int> dp(n);
    // Initialize base cases for dp table.
    dp[0] = stairs[0];
    dp[1] = stairs[1];

    // Iterate from stair 2 up to the last stair (n-1).
    for(int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        // The cost to reach stair 'i' is its own cost plus the minimum cost to reach either (i-1) or (i-2).
        int prevCost = min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]);
        dp[i] = stairs[i] + prevCost;
    }

    // The final answer is the minimum cost to reach the 'top' (after the last stair).
    // This means comparing the cost to reach (n-1)th stair and then step,
    // or the cost to reach (n-2)th stair and then step.
    return min(dp[n-1], dp[n-2]);
}

// 4. Dynamic Programming - Space Optimization Approach
// Optimizes the bottom-up approach to use only constant space.
// Time Complexity: O(N) - Single loop.
// Space Complexity: O(1) - Uses only a few variables.
// 'stairs': Vector containing costs.

    int n = stairs.size();

    // Handle edge cases for small 'n'.

    if (n == 1) return stairs[0];

    // 'prev0' stores the minimum cost to reach stair (i-2).
    // 'prev1' stores the minimum cost to reach stair (i-1).
    // Initialize for i=2: prev0 for stair 0, prev1 for stair 1.
    int prev0 = stairs[0]; // Corresponds to dp[0]
    int prev1 = stairs[1]; // Corresponds to dp[1]

    // Iterate from stair 2 up to the last stair (n-1).
    for(int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        // 'curr' calculates the minimum cost to reach current stair 'i'.
        int curr = stairs[i] + min(prev0, prev1);

        // Update for the next iteration:
        // 'prev0' becomes the old 'prev1' (now cost for (i-1)).
        // 'prev1' becomes the current 'curr' (now cost for 'i').
        prev0 = prev1;
        prev1 = curr;
    }

    // The final answer is the minimum of the cost to reach the last two stairs.
    // This is because you can reach the "top" from either stair (n-1) or stair (n-2).
    return min(prev0, prev1); // 'prev0' holds cost for (n-2), 'prev1' holds cost for (n-1) after loop.

### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Find the minimum cost to reach the top of a staircase.
  * **Input**: An integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `i`-th step.
  * **Constraint**: You can either climb one or two steps at a time.
  * **Starting Point**: You can start from either step 0 or step 1.
  * **Reaching the Top**: The "top" is considered one step beyond the last stair (index `n`). So, if there are `n` stairs, you need to reach index `n`.

### 2\. Problem Insight

This problem is a classic Dynamic Programming problem with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. The key observation is that to reach a certain stair `i`, you must have come from either stair `i-1` or stair `i-2`. The cost to reach `i` would then be `cost[i]` plus the minimum cost to reach `i-1` or `i-2`.

**Crucial Point**: The goal is to reach *the top*, which is *after* the last actual stair. If there are `n` stairs (indexed `0` to `n-1`), the "top" can be thought of as position `n`. You can reach position `n` either from stair `n-1` (taking 1 step) or from stair `n-2` (taking 2 steps). Thus, the final answer will be the minimum of `dp[n-1]` and `dp[n-2]`.

### 3\. Approaches to Solving

#### A. Recursive Approach (Brute Force)

  * **Idea**: Directly translate the recurrence relation. `minCost(i)` represents the minimum cost to reach stair `i`.
  * **Recurrence**: `minCost(i) = cost[i] + min(minCost(i-1), minCost(i-2))`
  * **Base Cases**:
      * `minCost(-1)` (or `i < 0`): `0` (cost to reach an imaginary step before the stairs, typically 0 for initialization)
      * `minCost(0)`: `cost[0]`
      * `minCost(1)`: `cost[1]`
  * **Function Call in `main`**: `min(minCost(stairs, n-1), minCost(stairs, n-2))` because you can start from 0 or 1, and the last two steps can lead to the 'top'.
  * **Pros**: Simple to write.
  * **Cons**: Highly inefficient due to **redundant calculations** (overlapping subproblems).
  * **Time Complexity**: $O(2^N)$ (Exponential, as it forms a recursion tree).
  * **Space Complexity**: $O(N)$ (Due to recursion stack depth).

#### B. Dynamic Programming - Top-Down (Memoization)

  * **Idea**: Optimize the recursive approach by storing the results of already computed subproblems in a `dp` table. Before computing `minCost(i)`, check if it's already in the `dp` table. If yes, return the stored value; otherwise, compute and store it.
  * **Pros**: Overcomes redundant calculations of pure recursion.
  * **Cons**: Still uses a recursion stack.
  * **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$ (Each `minCost(i)` is computed only once).
  * **Space Complexity**: $O(N)$ (For `dp` array) + $O(N)$ (For recursion stack) = $O(N)$.

#### C. Dynamic Programming - Bottom-Up (Tabulation)

  * **Idea**: Build the solution iteratively from the base cases upwards.
  * **Steps**:
    1.  Initialize `dp[0] = cost[0]` and `dp[1] = cost[1]`.
    2.  Iterate from `i = 2` to `n-1` (for stairs `2` up to `n-1`).
    3.  For each `i`, `dp[i] = cost[i] + min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2])`. `dp[i]` now stores the minimum cost to *reach* stair `i` and *pay* its cost.
    4.  The final answer is `min(dp[n-1], dp[n-2])`. This is because to reach the "top" (after `n-1` stair), you can either step from `n-1` (cost `dp[n-1]`) or from `n-2` (cost `dp[n-2]`).
  * **Pros**: No recursion stack overhead. Often preferred for its iterative nature and clear flow.
  * **Cons**: Requires an array of size $N$.
  * **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$ (Single loop).
  * **Space Complexity**: $O(N)$ (For `dp` array).

#### D. Dynamic Programming - Space Optimization

  * **Idea**: Observe that to calculate the current minimum cost to reach stair `i`, we only need the minimum costs to reach stairs `i-1` and `i-2`. We don't need the entire `dp` array. We can use just two variables (`prev0`, `prev1`) to store these previous two costs.
  * **Steps**:
    1.  Initialize `prev0 = cost[0]` and `prev1 = cost[1]`.
    2.  Iterate from `i = 2` to `n-1`.
    3.  Calculate `curr = cost[i] + min(prev0, prev1)`.
    4.  Update for next iteration: `prev0 = prev1; prev1 = curr;`
    5.  The final answer is `min(prev0, prev1)`.
  * **Pros**: Extremely efficient in terms of space.
  * **Cons**: Only applicable when current state depends only on a few previous states.
  * **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$ (Single loop).
  * **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ (Constant space, regardless of N).

### 4\. Important Considerations

  * **Meaning of `dp[i]`**: In this problem, `dp[i]` usually represents the minimum cost to *reach* stair `i` (including the cost of stair `i`).
  * **Reaching the Top**: The "top" is an imaginary step *after* the last stair. If there are `n` stairs (0 to `n-1`), the top is essentially index `n`. You can reach `n` from `n-1` or `n-2`. So, the minimum cost to reach the top is `min(dp[n-1], dp[n-2])`.
  * **Edge Cases for `n`**: Pay attention to small `n` values (e.g., `n=0`, `n=1`, `n=2`) as they are often base cases or require special handling. Your code correctly handles `n=0` by returning 0, and `n=1` and `n=2` directly in recursive/memoized solutions. In tabulation/space optimization, `n=0` or `n=1` might be handled implicitly or require an `if` block at the start. For `n=0` or `n=1` stairs, the loop for `i=2` to `n-1` won't run, and `prev0`, `prev1` (or `dp[0], dp[1]`) will contain the costs.
