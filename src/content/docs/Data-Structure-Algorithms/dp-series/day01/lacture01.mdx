```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> // Includes common standard libraries like iostream, vector.
using namespace std;     // Use the standard namespace.

// 1. Recursive Approach (Brute Force)
// Directly implements the Fibonacci recurrence relation.
// Time Complexity: O(2^N) - Exponential due to redundant calculations.
// Space Complexity: O(N) - Due to recursion stack depth.
int fibRec(int n) {
    if(n <= 1) { // Base cases: F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
        return n;
    }
    // Recursive calls: F(N) = F(N-1) + F(N-2)
    return fibRec(n-1) + fibRec(n-2);
}

// 2. Dynamic Programming - Top-Down Approach (Recursion + Memoization)
// Optimizes recursion by storing results of subproblems in a DP table to avoid re-calculation.
// 'n': The number for which Fibonacci is calculated.
// 'dp': A vector used as a memoization table, initialized with -1 (or some sentinel value).
// Time Complexity: O(N) - Each subproblem is computed only once.
// Space Complexity: O(N) for 'dp' vector + O(N) for recursion stack = O(N) total.
int fibDP_Memo(int n, vector<int> &dp) { // Renamed to avoid overload conflict in main if both fibDP were active
    if(n <= 1) { // Base cases: F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
        return n;
    }

    // If the result for 'n' is already computed and stored in dp table, return it.
    if(dp[n] != -1) {
        return dp[n];
    }

    // Compute the result and store it in dp table before returning.
    dp[n] = fibDP_Memo(n-1, dp) + fibDP_Memo(n-2, dp);
    return dp[n];
}

// 3. Dynamic Programming - Bottom-Up Approach (Tabulation)
// Builds the solution iteratively from base cases up to 'n'.
// 'n': The number for which Fibonacci is calculated.
// Time Complexity: O(N) - Single loop from 2 to N.
// Space Complexity: O(N) - For the 'dp' vector.
int fibDP_Tab(int n) { // Renamed to avoid overload conflict
    // Handle small 'n' values directly to prevent issues with dp table size (e.g., n=0, n=1).
    if (n <= 1) return n;

    // Create a dp table of size n+1 to store Fibonacci numbers up to F(n).
    vector<int> dp(n + 1);

    // Initialize base cases in the dp table.
    dp[0] = 0;
    dp[1] = 1;

    // Iterate from 2 up to 'n' to fill the dp table.
    // Each F(i) is the sum of the two preceding Fibonacci numbers.
    for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }

    // The result is stored at dp[n].
    return dp[n];
}

// 4. Dynamic Programming - Space Optimization Approach
// Further optimizes the bottom-up approach by using only a constant amount of space.
// It only needs the two previous Fibonacci numbers to calculate the current one.
// 'n': The number for which Fibonacci is calculated.
// Time Complexity: O(N) - Single loop from 2 to N.
// Space Complexity: O(1) - Uses only a few constant variables.
int fibDP_SpaceOpt(int n) { // Renamed for clarity
    if(n <= 1) { // Base cases: F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
        return n;
    }

    // Initialize variables to store the two previous Fibonacci numbers.
    // For i=2, prev1 holds F(1) and prev2 holds F(0).
    int prev1 = 1; // Corresponds to F(i-1)
    int prev2 = 0; // Corresponds to F(i-2)

    // Iterate from 2 up to 'n'.
    for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        // Calculate the current Fibonacci number.
        int curr = prev1 + prev2;

        // Update prev2 to hold the value that was prev1 (F(i-2) becomes F(i-1) for next iteration).
        prev2 = prev1;
        // Update prev1 to hold the value that was curr (F(i-1) becomes F(i) for next iteration).
        prev1 = curr;
    }

    // After the loop, prev1 will hold F(n).
    return prev1;
}

// Main function to demonstrate the usage of Fibonacci calculation methods.
int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter n (to calculate Nth Fibonacci number): ";
    cin >> n;

    // --- Uncomment one of the following lines to test different approaches ---

    // 1. Recursive (Brute Force) - Caution: Very slow for large N (e.g., N > 40)
    // int ans = fibRec(n);

    // 2. DP - Top-Down (Memoization)
    vector<int> dp(n + 1, -1); // Initialize dp table with -1
    int ans = fibDP_Memo(n, dp);

    // 3. DP - Bottom-Up (Tabulation)
    // int ans = fibDP_Tab(n);

    // 4. DP - Space Optimization
    // int ans = fibDP_SpaceOpt(n);


    cout << "The " << n << "th Fibonacci number is: " << ans << endl;

### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Calculate the Nth Fibonacci number, typically denoted as $F(N)$.
  * **Fibonacci Sequence Definition**: A sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.
      * $F(0) = 0$
      * $F(1) = 1$
      * $F(N) = F(N-1) + F(N-2)$ for $N \> 1$
  * **Example**: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

### 2\. Approaches to Solving Fibonacci

#### A. Recursive Approach (Brute Force)

  * **Idea**: Directly implement the recursive definition $F(N) = F(N-1) + F(N-2)$.
  * **Pros**: Simple and direct translation of the mathematical definition.
  * **Cons**: Highly inefficient due to **redundant calculations**. Many subproblems are re-calculated multiple times (e.g., $F(3)$ is calculated multiple times when finding $F(5)$).
  * **Time Complexity**: $O(2^N)$ (Exponential, as it forms a recursion tree).
  * **Space Complexity**: $O(N)$ (Due to recursion stack depth).

#### B. Dynamic Programming - Top-Down (Memoization)

  * **Idea**: Optimize the recursive approach by storing the results of already computed subproblems. Before computing $F(N)$, check if it's already in a `dp` table. If yes, return the stored value; otherwise, compute and store it.
  * **Pros**: Overcomes redundant calculations of pure recursion.
  * **Cons**: Still uses a recursion stack.
  * **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$ (Each $F(i)$ is computed only once).
  * **Space Complexity**: $O(N)$ (For `dp` array) + $O(N)$ (For recursion stack) = $O(N)$.

#### C. Dynamic Programming - Bottom-Up (Tabulation)

  * **Idea**: Build the solution iteratively from the base cases upwards. Start with $F(0)$ and $F(1)$, then calculate $F(2), F(3), \\dots, F(N)$ by directly using previously computed values.
  * **Pros**: No recursion stack overhead. Often preferred for its iterative nature and clearer flow.
  * **Cons**: Requires an array of size $N+1$.
  * **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$ (Single loop from 2 to N).
  * **Space Complexity**: $O(N)$ (For `dp` array).

#### D. Dynamic Programming - Space Optimization

  * **Idea**: Observe that to calculate $F(N)$, we only need $F(N-1)$ and $F(N-2)$. We don't need the entire `dp` array. We can use just two variables to store the previous two Fibonacci numbers.
  * **Pros**: Extremely efficient in terms of space.
  * **Cons**: Only applicable when current state depends only on a few previous states (not all previous states).
  * **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$ (Single loop from 2 to N).
  * **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ (Constant space, regardless of N).

| DP - Top-Down (Memo)   | $O(N)$          | $O(N)$           | Efficient, uses recursion + memoization.    |
| DP - Bottom-Up (Tab)   | $O(N)$          | $O(N)$           | Efficient, iterative, no recursion overhead.|
| DP - Space Optimized   | $O(N)$          | $O(1)$           | Most efficient for large N, no recursion.   |
