## Book Allocation Problem
- Each student gets a contiguous section of books.
- The maximum number of pages allocated to a student is minimized.
- No more than m students should be used to allocate the books.

```c++
#include<vector>
using namespace std;

// Function to check if it is possible to allocate books such that no student gets more than 'mid' pages
bool isPossible(vector<int> arr, int n, int m, int mid) {
    int studentCount = 1;   // Start by assigning books to the first student
    int pageSum = 0;        // Variable to keep track of the sum of pages assigned to the current student
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // If adding arr[i] (pages of the current book) to the current student's allocation keeps it <= mid
        if (pageSum + arr[i] <= mid) {
            pageSum += arr[i];   // Add the book to the current student's allocation
        } else {
            // If adding the current book exceeds 'mid', allocate it to a new student
            studentCount++;
            
            // If the number of students exceeds 'm' or if any book has more pages than 'mid', return false
            if (studentCount > m || arr[i] > mid) {
                return false;
            }

            // Allocate the current book to the new student
            pageSum = arr[i];
        }

        // If at any point, the number of students exceeds 'm', return false
        if (studentCount > m) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;   // If all books can be allocated within the given constraints, return true
}

// Function to find the minimum of the maximum number of pages a student can be allocated
int allocateBooks(vector<int> arr, int n, int m) {
    int s = 0;   // Start with the minimum possible number of pages (0)
    int sum = 0; // Sum of all pages in the array (total number of pages in all books)

    // Calculate the total number of pages
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    
    int e = sum;   // The upper limit of the number of pages (the sum of all pages)
    int ans = -1;  // Variable to store the result
    int mid = s + (e - s) / 2;  // Calculate the middle point of the current range

    // Perform binary search to minimize the maximum number of pages
    while (s <= e) {
        // Check if it's possible to allocate books with 'mid' as the maximum number of pages
        if (isPossible(arr, n, m, mid)) {
            ans = mid;   // If possible, store the current mid as a potential answer
            e = mid - 1; // Try to find a smaller maximum by reducing the search space
        } else {
            s = mid + 1; // If not possible, increase the minimum number of pages
        }
        mid = s + (e - s) / 2;  // Recalculate the middle point
    }
    return ans;  // Return the minimum of the maximum number of pages a student can be allocated
}
```

#### Example
Consider the following input:\
`arr = {10, 20, 30, 40}` (book pages)
`m = 2` (number of students)
- Step 1: Calculate the total sum of pages
    - `sum = 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 = 100`.
    - The minimum value for binary search (`s`) is `0`, and the maximum value (`e`) is `100`.
- Step 2: Binary Search for the Optimal Solution
    1. First Iteration:

        - `mid = (0 + 100) / 2 = 50`.
        - Check if it is possible to allocate books such that no student gets more than `50` pages.

        **Allocation for** `mid = 50`:
        - First student: `10 + 20 = 30` (next book exceeds 50).
        - Second student: `30 + 40 = 70`.
        - This allocation is possible, but there are exactly `2` students. So, the search space is reduced: `e = mid - 1 = 49`, and the current answer is `50`.
    2. Second Iteration:

        - `mid = (0 + 49) / 2 = 24`.

        **Allocation for** `mid = 24`:

        - First student: `10 + 20 = 30` (exceeds 24).
        - Second student: `30` (exceeds 24).
        - Third student: `40` (exceeds 24).
        - This is not possible, so we increase the search space: `s = mid + 1 = 25`.
    
    3. Third Iteration:
        - `mid = (25 + 49) / 2 = 37`.

        **Allocation for** `mid = 37`:
        - First student: `10 + 20 = 30` (next book exceeds 37).
        - Second student: `30` (next book exceeds 37).
        - Third student: `40` (exceeds 37).
        - Since this allocation requires more than `2` students, it's not possible to allocate books with `37` pages as the maximum. So, we increase the search space: `s = mid + 1 = 38`.
    4. Fourth Iteration:
        - `mid = (38 + 49) / 2 = 43`.

        **Allocation for** `mid = 43`:
        - First student: `10 + 20 = 30` (next book exceeds 43).
        - Second student: `30 + 40 = 70`.
        - This allocation is possible with exactly `2` students, so we update our answer to `43` and reduce the search space: `e = mid - 1 = 42`.
    5. Fifth Iteration:

        - `mid = (38 + 42) / 2 = 40`.

        **Allocation for** `mid = 40`:

        - First student: `10 + 20 = 30` (next book exceeds 40).
        - Second student: `30 + 40 = 70`.
        - This allocation is possible with `2` students, so we update our answer to `40` and reduce the search space: `e = mid - 1 = 39`.

    6. Sixth Iteration:

        - `mid = (38 + 39) / 2 = 38`.

        **Allocation for** `mid = 38`:

        - First student: `10 + 20 = 30` (next book exceeds 38).
        - Second student: `30 + 40 = 70`.
        - This allocation is possible, but the result is higher than `38`. Therefore, we increase the search space: `s = mid + 1 = 39`.

    7. Seventh Iteration:

        - `mid = (39 + 39) / 2 = 39`.

        **Allocation for** `mid = 39`:

        - First student: `10 + 20 = 30` (next book exceeds 39).
        - Second student: `30 + 40 = 70`.
        - This allocation is possible, but the result is still higher than `39`. Therefore, we increase the search space again: `s = mid + 1 = 40`.

At this point, `s = 40` and `e = 39`, so the loop exits. The final answer is the last valid value of ans, which is `40`.

##### Explanation of Logic
1. Setup:
    - Use binary search to find the minimum possible maximum pages. Set the lower bound (`s`) to 0 and the upper bound (`e`) to the sum of all book pages.
2. Binary Search:
    - Calculate the mid-point (`mid`) as `(s + e) / 2`, representing the potential maximum pages per student.
    - Use the isPossible function to check if books can be allocated without exceeding mid pages for any student.
3. Allocation Check:
    - In isPossible, iterate through the books and allocate them to students:
    - If adding a book keeps the total pages below mid, allocate it to the current student.
    - If it exceeds mid, assign it to a new student. If the required students exceed m, return false.
3. Adjusting Search Space:
    - If allocation is possible, reduce the upper bound (`e = mid - 1`) to find a smaller maximum.
    - If not possible, increase the lower bound (`s = mid + 1`) to allow for more pages.
4. Result:
    - The loop continues until `s > e`, and the last valid mid value is returned as the minimum maximum pages per student.
