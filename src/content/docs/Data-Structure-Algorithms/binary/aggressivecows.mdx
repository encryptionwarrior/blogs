## Aggressive Cows
we need to place cows in stalls such that the minimum distance between any two cows is maximized.
```c++
bool isPossible(vector<int> &stalls, int k, int mid, int n) {
    int cowCount = 1; // Start by placing the first cow in the first stall
    int lastPos = stalls[0]; // Track the last position where a cow was placed
    
    // Iterate through all stalls
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++ ){
        // Check if the current stall can accommodate a cow with at least 'mid' distance
        if(stalls[i] - lastPos >= mid) {
            cowCount++; // Place a cow
            // If we've placed all k cows, return true
            if(cowCount == k) {
                return true;
            }
            lastPos = stalls[i]; // Update the last position
        }
    }
    return false; // Not enough cows placed
}


int aggressiveCows(vector<int> &stalls, int k) {
    // Sort the stall positions
    sort(stalls.begin(), stalls.end());
    
    int s = 0; // Start of the search range
    int n = stalls.size(); // Total number of stalls
    int e = stalls[n - 1]; // End of the search range (last stall position)
    int ans = -1; // To store the final answer
    int mid = s + (e - s) / 2; // Calculate the mid-point for binary search
    
    // Perform binary search
    while(s <= e) {
        // Check if placing cows with at least 'mid' distance is possible
        if(isPossible(stalls, k, mid, n)) {
            ans = mid; // If possible, store the answer
            s = mid + 1; // Try for a larger distance
        }
        else {
            e = mid - 1; // Try for a smaller distance
        }
        mid = s + (e - s) / 2; // Update mid-point
    }
    return ans; // Return the maximum minimum distance
}

```

#### Example
```c++
stalls = {1, 2, 4, 8, 9} // positions of stalls
k = 3 // number of cows
```
1. Initial Setup:

- Sort the stalls: `{1, 2, 4, 8, 9}`
- Set search boundaries:
    - `s = 0` (minimum possible distance)
    - `e = 9` (maximum possible distance)
    - `ans = -1`

2. Binary Search Process:

    - First Iteration:

        - `mid = (0 + 9) / 2 = 4`
        - Check if we can place 3 cows with a minimum distance of `4` using `isPossible`.
        - Placement:
            - Place first cow at `1`
            - Next possible position for cow is 5, but it's not available. Thus, place second cow at `4`.
            - Not enough cows placed.
        - Result: not possible, update `e = mid - 1 = 3`.
    - Second Iteration:
        - `mid = (0 + 3) / 2 = 1`
        - Check if we can place `3` cows with a minimum distance of `1`.
        - Placement:
            - Place first cow at `1`
            - Place second cow at `2`
            - Place third cow at `4`
        - Result: possible, update `ans = 1` and `s = mid + 1 = 2`.
    
    - Third Iteration:
        - `mid = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2`
        - Check if we can place `3` cows with a minimum distance of `2`.
        - Placement:
            - Place first cow at `1`
            - Place second cow at `4`
            - Not enough cows placed.
        - Result: not possible, update `e = mid - 1 = 1`
    
    - Fourth Iteration:
        - `mid = (2 + 1) / 2 = 3`
        - Check if we can place 3 cows with a minimum distance of `3`.
        - Placement:
            - Place first cow at `1`
            - Next possible position for cow is `4` (place second cow here).
            - Not enough cows placed.
        - Result: not possible, update `e = mid - 1 = 2`.
3. Final Result:
    - The loop continues until `s > e`. The maximum minimum distance is found to be `1`.
