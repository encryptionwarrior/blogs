title: Queue Reversal
description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> // Includes standard libraries like iostream, queue, stack
using namespace std;     // Uses the standard namespace

// Function to reverse a queue using an auxiliary stack (Approach 1)
void Rev_Queue_App1(queue<int> &Q) {
    stack<int> temp; // Declare an auxiliary stack

    // Step 1: Transfer all elements from queue to stack
    // Elements are popped from queue (FIFO) and pushed onto stack (LIFO)
    // The first element of Q will be at the bottom of temp, last at top.
    while(!Q.empty()) {
        temp.push(Q.front()); // Get front element from queue and push to stack
        Q.pop();              // Remove the front element from queue
    }

    // Step 2: Transfer all elements from stack back to queue
    // Elements are popped from stack (LIFO) and pushed onto queue (FIFO)
    // The last element of original Q (top of stack) goes in first, effectively reversing order.
    while(!temp.empty()) {
        Q.push(temp.top()); // Get top element from stack and push to queue
        temp.pop();         // Remove the top element from stack
    }
}

// Helper function to print the elements of a queue (consumes the queue)
void print(queue<int> Q) {
    // Loop while the queue is not empty
    while(!Q.empty()) {
        cout << Q.front() << " "; // Print the front element
        Q.pop();                  // Remove the front element
    }
    cout << endl; // Print a newline at the end
}

int main() {
    queue<int> Q; // Declare a queue of integers

    // Push elements into the queue
    Q.push(77);
    Q.push(65);
    Q.push(98);
    Q.push(46);
    Q.push(32);
    // Initial Queue: [77, 65, 98, 46, 32] (Front: 77, Rear: 32)

    cout << "Before reverse : ";
    print(Q); // Print the queue before reversal

    Rev_Queue_App1(Q); // Call the function to reverse the queue

    cout << "After reverse : "; // Corrected output string (original had "Before reverse")
    print(Q); // Print the queue after reversal
    // Expected Output Queue: [32, 46, 98, 65, 77] (Front: 32, Rear: 77)

    return 0; // End of program
}
```

### Problem

  * Reverse the order of elements in a given queue.
  * A queue follows FIFO (First-In, First-Out) principle. Reversing it means making it LIFO (Last-In, First-Out).

### Approach 1: Using an Auxiliary Stack

  * **Core Idea**: Leverage the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) property of a stack to counteract the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) property of a queue.
  * **Steps**:
    1.  **Transfer to Stack**: Dequeue all elements from the original `queue` one by one and `push` them onto an auxiliary `stack`.
          * The element that was at the `front` of the queue will be at the `bottom` of the stack.
          * The element that was at the `rear` of the queue will be at the `top` of the stack.
    2.  **Transfer back to Queue**: `Pop` all elements from the auxiliary `stack` one by one and `enqueue` them back into the original `queue`.
          * The element at the `top` of the stack (which was the last element of the original queue) will be `enqueued first`, becoming the new `front`.
          * This process continues until the stack is empty, effectively reversing the order of elements in the queue.

### Complexity Analysis

  * **Time Complexity**: O(N)
      * Each of the N elements is dequeued from the queue once.
      * Each of the N elements is pushed onto the stack once.
      * Each of the N elements is popped from the stack once.
      * Each of the N elements is enqueued back into the queue once.
      * Total operations are proportional to N (4N operations), hence O(N).
  * **Space Complexity**: O(N)
      * An auxiliary `stack` is used to store all N elements from the queue.
