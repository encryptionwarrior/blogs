### Celebrity Problem 
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> // Standard headers (iostream, vector, stack)
using namespace std;     // Standard namespace

// Function to find the celebrity in a given matrix
int findCelebrity(vector<vector<int>> matrix) {
    stack<int> st; // Stack to store potential celebrity candidates
    int n = matrix.size(); // Size of the matrix (number of people)

    // Step 1: Push all person indices onto the stack
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        st.push(i);
    }

    // Step 2: Eliminate non-celebrity candidates
    while(st.size() > 1) { // Continue until only one candidate remains
        int a = st.top(); // Get top two candidates
        st.pop();
        int b = st.top();
        st.pop();

        // Step 3: Determine who might be the celebrity based on knowing each other
        if(matrix[a][b] == 1) { // If 'a' knows 'b'
            // 'a' cannot be celebrity (because celebrity knows no one)
            st.push(b); // 'b' is still a potential celebrity
        } else { // If 'a' does NOT know 'b' (matrix[a][b] == 0)
            // 'b' cannot be celebrity (because celebrity must be known by everyone)
            st.push(a); // 'a' is still a potential celebrity
        }
    }

    // Step 4: The single element left is the potential celebrity
    int candidate = st.top(); // This is our final potential candidate

    // Step 5: Verify if the candidate meets both celebrity conditions
    // Condition 1: Candidate must not know anyone
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(matrix[candidate][i] == 1) { // If candidate knows anyone (M[candidate][i] is 1)
            return -1; // Not a celebrity
        }
    }

    // Condition 2: Everyone must know the candidate (except candidate themselves)
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(matrix[i][candidate] == 0 && i != candidate) { // If someone (i != candidate) does NOT know candidate (M[i][candidate] is 0)
            return -1; // Not a celebrity
        }
    }

    // If both conditions are met, the candidate is indeed the celebrity
    return candidate;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> matrix;
    int size;

    cout << "Enter the size (N) of the matrix : ";
    cin >> size; // Read matrix size

    cout << "Enter the matrix elements (0s and 1s, N x N):" << endl;
    for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        vector<int> row(size); // Create a row vector
        for(int j = 0; j < size; j++) { // Corrected inner loop variable to 'j'
            cin >> row[j]; // Read element for current row
        }
        matrix.push_back(row); // Add row to matrix
    }

    int celeb = findCelebrity(matrix); // Find the celebrity
    cout << "Celebrity element : " << celeb << endl; // Print result

    /* Example Input (N=3):
    0 1 0
    0 0 0
    0 1 0
    Output: Celebrity element : 1
    (Person 1 is known by 0 and 2, and 1 knows no one)

    Example Input (N=3, No celebrity):
    0 1 1
    0 0 0
    0 1 0
    Output: Celebrity element : -1
    (Person 1 is not known by person 0, but person 0 knows person 1 and 2)
    */

    return 0; // End program
}
```


### Problem Definition

  * Given an `N x N` matrix `M` where `M[i][j] = 1` means person `i` knows person `j`, and `0` otherwise.
  * A **Celebrity** is a person who:
    1.  Is known by everyone else.
    2.  Does not know anyone else. (Except potentially themselves, `M[i][i]` is usually 0 but doesn't matter for the definition.)

### Core Idea: Elimination using Stack

  * **Pairwise Elimination**: The stack helps in efficiently eliminating non-celebrity candidates.
  * If `A` knows `B` (`M[A][B] == 1`), then `A` cannot be the celebrity (as a celebrity knows no one). `B` might be.
  * If `A` does **not** know `B` (`M[A][B] == 0`), then `B` cannot be the celebrity (as a celebrity must be known by everyone). `A` might be.
  * This process eliminates one candidate in each comparison, leaving a single potential celebrity.
  * **Verification**: The final candidate must be *rigorously checked* against the celebrity definition.

### Algorithm Steps

1.  **Push All**: Push all `N` person indices (0 to `N-1`) onto a stack.
2.  **Elimination Loop**: While the stack size is not `1`:
      * Pop two persons, `A` and `B`.
      * If `M[A][B] == 1` (A knows B): `A` is not celebrity. Push `B` back.
      * Else (`M[A][B] == 0`, A does not know B): `B` is not celebrity. Push `A` back.
3.  **Potential Celebrity**: The single element left in the stack is the `candidate`.
4.  **Verification**: Iterate through all `N` persons (including the candidate itself):
      * Check if `candidate` knows *anyone* (`M[candidate][i] == 1` for `i != candidate`). If yes, return `-1`.
      * Check if *everyone* (except themselves) knows `candidate` (`M[i][candidate] == 0` for `i != candidate`). If not, return `-1`.
5.  If all checks pass, return `candidate`.
