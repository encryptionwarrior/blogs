```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> // Standard headers (iostream, string, stack)
using namespace std;     // Standard namespace

// Function to check if an expression contains redundant brackets
bool redundantBracket(string str) {
    stack<char> st; // Stack to store operators and opening brackets

    for(int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) { // Iterate through the expression
        char ch = str[i]; // Current character

        // If it's an opening bracket or an operator, push onto stack
        if(ch == '(' || ch == '+' || ch == '-' || ch == '*' || ch == '/') {
            st.push(ch);
        }
        // If it's a closing bracket ')' or an operand (like 'a', 'b') - though operands are usually ignored
        else {
            if(ch == ')') { // Only process if it's a closing bracket
                bool isRedundant = true; // Assume current bracket is redundant initially

                // Pop elements until the matching opening '(' is found
                while(st.top() != '(') {
                    char topElement = st.top();
                    // If an operator is found, the bracket is NOT redundant
                    if(topElement == '+' || topElement == '-' || topElement == '*' || topElement == '/') {
                        isRedundant = false; // Found an operator, so not redundant
                    }
                    st.pop(); // Pop the operator/operand
                }

                // After loop, if 'isRedundant' is still true, it means no operator was found
                if(isRedundant == true) {
                    return true; // Redundant bracket found!
                }
                st.pop(); // Pop the matching opening '('
            }
            // Other characters (operands like 'a', 'b', 'c') are simply ignored.
            // If they are not handled, ensure they don't break logic.
            // For this problem, we only care about brackets and operators.
        }
    }

    // If loop finishes, no redundant brackets were found
    return false; // No redundant brackets detected
}

int main() {
    string str;

    cout << "Enter the expression : "; // Prompt for expression
    getline(cin, str);                 // Read the entire line

    if(redundantBracket(str)) { // Check for redundancy
        cout << "TRUE (Redundant bracket found)" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "FALSE (No redundant bracket)" << endl;
    }

    // Test cases:
    // ((a+b)) -> TRUE
    // (a+(b)/c) -> TRUE
    // (a+b) -> FALSE
    // (a+(b*c)) -> FALSE

    return 0; // End program
}
```

### Core Idea

  * **Stack for Tracking**: Use a stack to keep track of opening brackets and operators.
  * **Redundancy**: A pair of parentheses `()` is redundant if it encloses *no operators* (only an operand or another redundant sub-expression). Example: `(a)`, `((a+b))`
  * **Algorithm**:
    1.  Push opening brackets and operators onto the stack.
    2.  When a closing bracket `)` is found:
          * Pop elements from the stack until the corresponding opening `(` is found.
          * During this popping, if you encounter *any* operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), it means the `()` pair is *not* redundant.
          * If you reach the `(` without encountering any operator, then the `()` pair is redundant.

### How it Works

1.  **Iterate**: Loop through the expression character by character.
2.  **Push**: If the character is an opening bracket `(` or an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), push it onto the stack.
3.  **Handle `)`**: If the character is a closing bracket `)`:
      * Set a `redundancy` flag to `true` (assume redundant until an operator is found).
      * **Pop till `(`**: Continuously pop elements from the stack until the matching `(` is found.
      * **Check Operators**: For each popped element:
          * If it's an operator, set `redundancy = false` (this means the bracket pair contains an operation, so it's not redundant).
      * **Check Redundancy Flag**: After popping up to `(`, if `redundancy` is still `true`, it means no operator was found inside this pair, so it's a redundant bracket. Return `false` (meaning "redundant bracket found").
      * Finally, pop the `(` from the stack.
4.  **End of String**: If the loop finishes without returning `false`, it means no redundant brackets were found. Return `true` (meaning "no redundant brackets").
