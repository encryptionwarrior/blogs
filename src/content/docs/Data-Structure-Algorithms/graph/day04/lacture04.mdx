// 'edges': A vector of vectors, where each inner vector {u, v, w} represents an edge u-v with weight w.
//          Assumed to be undirected if edges are added bidirectionally.
// 'n': Total number of nodes (vertices). Assumed to be 0-indexed (0 to n-1).
// 'm': Total number of edges.

### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Find the shortest path (minimum total weight) from a given `source` node to all other reachable nodes in a **weighted graph with non-negative edge weights**.
  * **Key Constraint**: All edge weights must be **non-negative**. Dijkstra's algorithm does not work correctly with negative edge weights. For graphs with negative weights (but no negative cycles), Bellman-Ford algorithm is used. For general graphs (possibly with negative cycles), SPFA or Bellman-Ford is used, or Floyd-Warshall for all-pairs shortest paths.
  * **Input**: List of weighted `edges (u, v, w)`, total `n` nodes, total `m` edges, `src` (source node).
  * **Output**: A vector `distance` where `distance[i]` is the shortest path distance from `src` to node `i`. `INT_MAX` indicates unreachable.

### 2\. Core Idea

Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that works in a similar way to BFS, but it prioritizes visiting nodes with the smallest *current shortest distance* from the source.

  * It maintains a set of visited nodes (or more accurately, nodes for which the shortest path has been finalized).
  * It uses a **min-priority queue** (implemented here using a `std::set` ordered by distance) to efficiently select the unvisited node with the smallest distance.
  * When a node `u` is extracted from the priority queue, its distance (`distance[u]`) is considered finalized.
  * Then, it explores all neighbors `v` of `u` and tries to "relax" the edges: if `distance[u] + weight(u,v)` is less than `distance[v]`, it means a shorter path to `v` has been found through `u`. In this case, `distance[v]` is updated, and `v` (with its new distance) is added/updated in the priority queue.

### 3\. Algorithm Steps (`shortestPath` function)

1.  **Build Adjacency List**:

      * Create an `adjList` (`unordered_map<int, list<pair<int, int>>>`).
      * For each edge `(u, v, w)`, add `v` with weight `w` to `adjList[u]`.
      * Since it's an undirected graph (implied by adding both `u -> v` and `v -> u`), also add `u` with weight `w` to `adjList[v]`.

2.  **Initialize Distance Array & Priority Queue**:

      * `distance`: A `vector<int>` of size `n`, initialized to `INT_MAX` (representing infinity).
      * `st` (or `pq`): A `std::set<pair<int, int>>` (or `std::priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>>`). This set stores `(current_distance, node_id)` pairs, ordered by `current_distance` (min-heap behavior).
      * Set `distance[src] = 0`.
      * Insert `{0, src}` into `st`.

3.  **Dijkstra's Main Loop**: While `st` is not empty:

      * **Extract Minimum**: Get the `(nodeDistance, topNode)` pair with the smallest `nodeDistance` from `st`.
          * `pair<int, int> curr = *(st.begin());`
          * `int nodeDistance = curr.first;`
          * `int topNode = curr.second;`
      * **Remove from Set**: `st.erase(st.begin());` (Crucial to avoid reprocessing with outdated distances).
      * **Explore Neighbors**: For each `neighbor (neigh.first)` with `edgeWeight (neigh.second)` in `adjList[topNode]`:
          * **Relaxation**: If `nodeDistance + neigh.second < distance[neigh.first]`:
              * **Remove Old Record (if exists)**: If `neigh.first` was already in the `st` with a larger distance, `st.find()` and `st.erase()` that old record. This is unique to `std::set` implementation; `std::priority_queue` doesn't support this and might push redundant entries, which are handled by checking `distance[node] < nodeDistance` when extracted.
              * **Update Distance**: `distance[neigh.first] = nodeDistance + neigh.second;`
              * **Insert New Record**: `st.insert({distance[neigh.first], neigh.first});` (Add the neighbor with its new, smaller distance).

4.  **Return**: The `distance` vector.

### 4\. Time and Space Complexity

  * **Time Complexity**:
      * Building `adjList`: `O(M)`.
      * Dijkstra's loop: Each vertex is extracted from the `set` at most once (`O(V)` extractions). For each extraction, its neighbors are iterated (`O(E)` total edge relaxations). Each `set` operation (`insert`, `erase`, `find`) takes `O(log V)` time (since the set can contain up to `V` elements).
      * Total: `O(E log V)` if using `std::set` or `std::priority_queue`.
          * If using a Fibonacci heap (more complex data structure), it can be `O(E + V log V)`.
  * **Space Complexity**:
      * `adjList`: `O(V + E)`.
      * `distance` vector: `O(V)`.
      * `set` (or `priority_queue`): `O(V)` in the worst case (stores all vertices).
      * Total: `O(V + E)`.

### 5\. Why `std::set` as a Priority Queue?

  * `std::set` stores elements in sorted order. When pairs `(distance, node)` are inserted, they are naturally ordered by distance (first element of pair).
  * `*(st.begin())` gives the element with the smallest distance.
  * `st.erase(st.begin())` removes the smallest element.
  * Crucially, `std::set` allows efficient `find` and `erase` of arbitrary elements (`log V`), which is useful when a node's distance is updated. This prevents outdated entries from accumulating in the "priority queue" and being processed unnecessarily, leading to a cleaner implementation.
  * A standard `std::priority_queue` cannot efficiently remove arbitrary elements. When using `std::priority_queue`, you'd push new (shorter) paths, and when you extract a node, you'd check `if (nodeDistance > distance[topNode]) continue;` to skip outdated entries.
