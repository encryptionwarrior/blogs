### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Find the shortest path (minimum total weight) from a given `source` node to all other reachable nodes in a **Weighted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**.
  * **Key Constraint**: This algorithm works *only* for DAGs. It handles negative edge weights correctly as long as there are no negative cycles.
  * **Input**: A graph represented by its edges (implicitly built into the `Graph` class), `n` nodes (here hardcoded to 6 in some parts, ideally dynamic), `src` (source node).
  * **Output**: A vector `distance` where `distance[i]` is the shortest path distance from `src` to node `i`. `INT_MAX` indicates unreachable.

### 2\. Core Idea

This method leverages two main steps:

1.  **Topological Sort**: Since the graph is a DAG, we can find a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge `u -> v`, `u` comes before `v` in the ordering. This is crucial because it ensures that when we process a node, all its direct or indirect prerequisites have already been processed and their shortest paths calculated.
2.  **Single Pass Relaxation**: Once we have the topological order, we iterate through the nodes in that specific order. For each node, we "relax" all its outgoing edges. Relaxing an edge `u -> v` with weight `w` means checking if the path to `v` through `u` (`distance[u] + w`) is shorter than the currently known `distance[v]`. If it is, we update `distance[v]`.

### 3\. Algorithm Steps (within `Graph` class)

#### A. `Graph` Class Structure

  * **`AdjList`**: `unordered_map<int, list<pair<int,int>>>` to store the graph. Each key is a node `u`, and its value is a list of pairs `{v, weight}` representing directed edges `u -> v` with `weight`.
  * **`addEdge(u, v, weight)`**: Adds a directed edge `u -> v` with the given `weight` to the `AdjList`.
  * **`printEdge()`**: Utility function to display the adjacency list.

#### B. Topological Sort (`topoSort` and `solveDFS` methods)

  * **`solveDFS(stack<int> &st, vector<int> &visited, int node)`**:

      * This is a private helper method for DFS.
      * `visited[node] = 1;` (Mark current node as visited).
      * For each `neighbor` in `AdjList[node]`:
          * If `neighbor` is `unvisited`, recursively call `solveDFS` on `neighbor`.
      * **Crucial Step**: After all descendants of `node` (and their subgraphs) have been fully explored, push `node` onto the `st`. This ensures that a node is pushed only after all nodes reachable from it have been pushed.

  * **`topoSort()`**:

      * Initializes an empty `stack<int> st` and a `vector<int> visited(N_NODES, 0)` (where `N_NODES` is fixed to 6 here, but should ideally be dynamic based on graph input).
      * Iterates through potential node IDs (0 to N\_NODES-1).
      * If a node `x.first` (from `AdjList` iteration) is unvisited, it calls `solveDFS(st, visited, x.first)` to start DFS for that component. This handles disconnected DAGs.
      * Returns the populated `st` containing the topological order.

#### C. Shortest Path Calculation (`shortestPath` method)

1.  **Initialize Distance Array**:

      * `vector<int> distance(N_NODES, INT_MAX);` (where `N_NODES` is 6). All distances are initially infinity.
      * `distance[src] = 0;` (Distance from source to itself is 0).

2.  **Get Topological Order**:

      * `stack<int> st = topoSort();` (Call the `topoSort` method to get the ordered stack).

3.  **Process Nodes in Topological Order & Relax Edges**:

      * While `st` is not empty:
          * `val = st.top(); st.pop();` (Get the next node in topological order).
          * **Important Check**: `if (distance[val] != INT_MAX)`: This condition ensures we only process nodes that are reachable from the source. If `val` is unreachable (`INT_MAX`), trying to add to it would lead to overflow or incorrect results.
          * For each `neighbor (x.first)` with `weight (x.second)` in `AdjList[val]`:
              * **Relaxation Step**: If `distance[val] + x.second < distance[x.first]`:
                  * `distance[x.first] = distance[val] + x.second;` (Update the shortest distance to `x.first`).

4.  **Return**: The `distance` vector.

### 4\. Time and Space Complexity

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * Building `AdjList` (done externally in `main` then passed or implicitly from `addEdge` calls): `O(E)`.
      * `topoSort` (which calls `solveDFS`): Each vertex and edge is visited once. `O(V + E)`.
      * Distance array initialization: `O(V)`.
      * Relaxation loop: Each vertex is processed once, and for each vertex, its outgoing edges are iterated. Each edge is relaxed exactly once. `O(V + E)`.
      * Total: `O(V + E)`.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * `AdjList`: `O(V + E)`.
      * `visited` vector: `O(V)`.
      * `stack` for topological sort: `O(V)`.
      * `distance` vector: `O(V)`.

### 5\. Important Notes/Caveats

  * **Hardcoded `n` (6) in `visited` and `distance` arrays**: The code has `vector<int> visited(6,0);` and `vector<int> distance(6, INT_MAX);`. This means it assumes exactly 6 nodes (0 to 5). For a general solution, `n` should be passed to `topoSort` and `shortestPath`, and these vectors should be sized dynamically `vector<int> visited(n,0);` and `vector<int> distance(n, INT_MAX);`.
  * **Node Indexing**: The current code assumes 0-indexed nodes (0 to N-1).
  * **Disconnected Components**: The `topoSort` function correctly handles disconnected components by iterating through all possible nodes and starting a DFS if unvisited.
  * **Negative Cycles**: This algorithm will not work correctly if the graph contains negative weight cycles, as distances would keep decreasing infinitely. This algorithm is specifically for DAGs.
