### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Find the shortest path (minimum total weight) from a given `source` node to all other reachable nodes in a **Weighted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**.
  * **Key Constraint**: This algorithm works *only* for DAGs. It does not work for graphs with cycles, especially those with negative weight cycles.
  * **Input**: List of weighted directed `edges (u, v, w)`, total `n` nodes, total `m` edges, `src` (source node).
  * **Output**: A vector `distance` where `distance[i]` is the shortest path distance from `src` to node `i`. `INT_MAX` indicates unreachable.

### 2\. Core Idea

The shortest path in a DAG can be found efficiently by combining:

1.  **Topological Sort**: First, compute a topological ordering of the graph's nodes. This ensures that when we process a node, all its prerequisites (nodes that must come before it in any path) have already been processed.
2.  **Single Pass Relaxation**: Iterate through the nodes in topological order. For each node, relax all its outgoing edges. "Relaxing an edge" `u -> v` with weight `w` means updating `distance[v]` if `distance[u] + w` is less than the current `distance[v]`.

### 3\. Algorithm Steps

#### A. Topological Sort (DFS-based)

  * **`solveDFS` function**:
      * Parameters: `adjList`, `st` (a stack), `visited` array, `node`.
      * Mark `visited[node] = true`.
      * Recursively call `solveDFS` for all unvisited neighbors.
      * **Crucial**: After all neighbors and their descendants are processed, push `node` onto `st`.
  * **`topoSort` function**:
      * Builds the `adjList` from input (if not already built).
      * Initializes `visited` array and an empty `stack st`.
      * Iterates through all nodes (`0` to `n-1`). If `!visited[node]`, calls `solveDFS` to start DFS for that component.
      * Returns the populated `stack st`.

#### B. Shortest Path Calculation (`shortestPath` function)

1.  **Build Adjacency List**: Create `adjList` from the input `edges`. For weighted directed edges `u -> v` with weight `w`, store `v` and `w` (e.g., `adjList[u].push_back({v, w})`).
2.  **Perform Topological Sort**: Call `topoSort(adjList, n)` to get the topological order in a stack.
3.  **Initialize Distance Array**:
      * Create `vector<int> distance(n, INT_MAX)`.
      * Set `distance[src] = 0`. All other nodes are initially unreachable (`INT_MAX`).
4.  **Process Nodes in Topological Order**:
      * While the topological sort stack `st` is not empty:
          * `node = st.top(); st.pop();` (Get the next node in topological order).
          * **Important Check**: If `distance[node] != INT_MAX` (meaning `node` is reachable from `src`):
              * For each `neighbor (x.first)` and its `weight (x.second)` from `adjList[node]`:
                  * **Relaxation Step**: If `distance[node] + x.second < distance[x.first]`:
                      * `distance[x.first] = distance[node] + x.second;` (Update the shortest distance to `x.first`).
5.  **Return**: The `distance` vector.

### 4\. Time and Space Complexity

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * Building `adjList`: `O(E)`.
      * Topological Sort (DFS): Each vertex and edge visited once. `O(V + E)`.
      * Distance initialization: `O(V)`.
      * Relaxation step: Each vertex is popped once. For each vertex, its outgoing edges are iterated. Each edge is relaxed exactly once. `O(V + E)`.
      * Total: `O(V + E)`.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * `adjList`: `O(V + E)`.
      * `visited` vector: `O(V)`.
      * `stack` for topological sort: `O(V)`.
      * `distance` vector: `O(V)`.

### 5\. Why it works for DAGs and not general graphs

  * In a DAG, the topological sort guarantees that all predecessors of a node are processed *before* the node itself. This means by the time we process `node`, `distance[node]` already holds the correct shortest path from `src` (assuming `src` itself is processed before or is the first node).
  * In graphs with cycles (especially negative cycles), this single-pass relaxation won't work, as distances might continuously decrease, and there's no fixed order to guarantee correct processing. For general graphs, Dijkstra's (non-negative weights) or Bellman-Ford (can handle negative weights, detects negative cycles) are used.
