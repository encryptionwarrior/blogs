```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> // Includes common standard libraries like iostream, vector.
using namespace std;     // Use the standard namespace.

// Function to convert an edge list representation of an undirected graph
// into an adjacency list representation.
// 'n': The number of nodes (vertices). Nodes are assumed to be 0-indexed to n-1.
// 'm': The number of edges.
// 'edges': A vector of vectors, where each inner vector {u, v} represents an edge between u and v.
// Returns a vector of vectors representing the adjacency list.
vector<vector<int>> printAdjacency(int n, int m, vector<vector<int>> &edges) {
    // Create an adjacency list structure: 'solution' is a vector of vectors.
    // 'solution[i]' will store the list of neighbors for node 'i'.
    // Initialized to size 'n', so solution[0]...solution[n-1] exist.
    vector<vector<int>> solution(n);

    // Initialize each node's list with its own ID (specific output format requirement).
    // A typical adjacency list would not include the node's own ID initially.
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        solution[i].push_back(i); // Add node 'i' itself as the first element in its list.
    }

    // Iterate through each edge in the input 'edges' list.
    for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int u = edges[i][0]; // Get the first node of the current edge.
        int v = edges[i][1]; // Get the second node of the current edge.

        // Since it's an UNDIRECTED graph:
        // Add 'v' to the adjacency list of 'u'.
        solution[u].push_back(v);
        // Add 'u' to the adjacency list of 'v'.
        solution[v].push_back(u);

    // Create a vector to store the 'm' edges.

    // Call the function to convert edge list to adjacency list.
    vector<vector<int>> solution = printAdjacency(n, m, edges);

        for(auto neighbor_or_self : current_node_list) { // Iterate through elements in that list.
            cout << neighbor_or_self << " "; // Print node ID or neighbor ID.

### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Given the number of nodes (`n`), the number of edges (`m`), and a list of `m` edges (each edge represented as a pair of connected nodes `(u, v)`), construct and return the Adjacency List representation of the graph.
  * **Assumption**: The provided code specifically implements an **undirected graph**.
  * **Output Format**: The adjacency list is returned as a `vector<vector<int>>`, where `solution[i]` is a vector containing `i` itself (as the first element) followed by all its neighbors.

### 2\. Graph Representations Revisited

  * **Adjacency List**: The most common and often efficient way to represent graphs, especially sparse ones (few edges).
      * It's essentially an array (or vector) where each index `i` stores a list of all vertices adjacent to `i`.
      * For `u -> v`, `v` is added to `u`'s list.
      * For `u - v` (undirected), `v` is added to `u`'s list, and `u` is added to `v`'s list.
  * **Edge List**: A simple list of all edges in the graph, e.g., `[(u1, v1), (u2, v2), ...]`. This is the input format for this problem.

### 3\. Algorithm Steps

1.  **Initialization**:

      * Create a `vector<vector<int>> solution` of size `n`. This will store the adjacency lists. Each `solution[i]` will be a `vector<int>` representing the neighbors of node `i`.
      * **Self-inclusion (Specific to this code's output format)**: The code initializes `solution[i]` by `solution[i].push_back(i);`. This means each node's own ID will be the first element in its corresponding adjacency list. This is a specific output requirement and not standard for *just* neighbors. A typical adjacency list would just store the neighbors.

2.  **Processing Edges**:

      * Iterate through each `edge` in the input `edges` list.
      * For each edge `(u, v)`:
          * Add `v` to the adjacency list of `u`: `solution[u].push_back(v);`
          * Add `u` to the adjacency list of `v`: `solution[v].push_back(u);` (This handles the undirected nature of the graph).

3.  **Return**: The `solution` vector, which now contains the adjacency list representation.

### 4\. Time and Space Complexity

  * Let `N` be the number of nodes and `M` be the number of edges.

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N + M)`

      * **Initialization**: `O(N)` for creating the `N` empty vectors and `N` pushes for self-inclusion.
      * **Processing Edges**: The loop runs `M` times. Inside the loop, `vector::push_back` is `O(1)` on average. Since each undirected edge adds two entries (one for `u`, one for `v`), this is `O(M)`.
      * **Total**: `O(N + M)`. This is highly efficient.

  * **Space Complexity**: `O(N + M)`

      * The `solution` vector stores `N` outer vectors.
      * In total, it stores `N` node IDs (for self-inclusion) plus `2*M` entries (for `M` undirected edges). This sum is proportional to `N + M`.

### 5\. Key Concepts

  * **Adjacency List**: An efficient way to store graph connections, especially for sparse graphs.
  * **Edge List**: A straightforward way to provide graph input.
  * **Undirected Graph**: Edges are bidirectional.
  * **Graph Traversal**: Once an adjacency list is built, it's used as the primary structure for algorithms like BFS, DFS, etc.
