using namespace std;     // Use the standard namespace.

### 1\. What is a Generic Graph?

  * A **generic graph** allows vertices (nodes) to be represented by data types other than just integers (e.g., characters, strings, custom objects).
  * This is achieved using C++ **templates**, making the `Graph` class reusable for various node types.

### 2\. Adjacency List Representation (Templated)

  * **Data Structure**: `unordered_map<T, list<T>> adj`
      * `T`: This is a template type parameter, meaning `T` can be any data type (e.g., `int`, `char`, `string`, etc.) that supports hashing (for `unordered_map`) and comparison.
      * `unordered_map`: Maps a vertex of type `T` to a list of its neighbors (also of type `T`).
      * `list<T>`: Represents the list of adjacent vertices for a given key vertex. `std::vector<T>` or `std::set<T>` could also be used, depending on requirements (e.g., `vector` for better cache locality, `set` for sorted unique neighbors, `list` for efficient insertions/deletions anywhere).

### 3\. Key Functions & Enhancements

  * **`template <typename T>`**: This syntax declares that the `Graph` class (and its methods) will operate on a generic type `T`.
  * **`addEdge(T u, T v, bool direction)`**:
      * Adds an edge between vertices `u` and `v`.
      * `u`, `v` are now of type `T`, allowing for flexible node naming.
      * `direction`: `false` for undirected (adds `u-v` and `v-u`), `true` for directed (adds `u->v` only).
  * **`printAdjList()`**: Iterates through the `adj` map and prints each vertex (`i.first`) and its list of neighbors (`i.second`). The `cout` statements will automatically adapt to the type `T` if `operator<<` is defined for `T`.

### 4\. Time and Space Complexity (Same as non-templated)

  * **Space Complexity**: `O(V + E)` where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges. This holds true as the underlying structure (`unordered_map` and `list`) scales with the number of vertices and edges, regardless of their data type (assuming `T` has constant-time copy/move).
  * **Time Complexity**:
      * `addEdge()`: `O(1)` on average (for `unordered_map::operator[]` and `list::push_back`).
      * `printAdjList()`: `O(V + E)` because it visits each vertex and each edge once.

### 5\. Benefits of Using Templates

  * **Reusability**: The same `Graph` class can be used for graphs where nodes are `int`, `char`, `string`, or even complex custom objects, without writing separate code for each type.
  * **Type Safety**: The compiler ensures type correctness at compile time.
  * **Flexibility**: Adapts to different problem requirements that might use non-integer node identifiers.

### 6\. Usage in `main()`

  * **`Graph<int> G;`**: When using the templated `Graph` class, you must specify the actual type for `T` inside angle brackets (e.g., `<int>`). You could create `Graph<char> G_char;` or `Graph<string> G_string;` if needed.
  * The rest of the `main` function remains similar to the non-templated version, as the input is still read as integers. If `T` were `char` or `string`, `cin >> u >> v;` would need to read `char` or `string` values.
