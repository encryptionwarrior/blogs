### 1\. What is a Graph?

  * A **Graph** is a non-linear data structure consisting of a set of **vertices** (or nodes) and a set of **edges** (connections between vertices).
  * **Vertices (Nodes)**: The individual entities in the graph.
  * **Edges**: The links or connections between pairs of vertices.

### 2\. Types of Graphs

  * **Undirected Graph**: Edges have no direction (if `u` is connected to `v`, `v` is also connected to `u`).
  * **Directed Graph (Di-graph)**: Edges have a direction (if there's an edge from `u` to `v`, it doesn't necessarily mean there's an edge from `v` to `u`).
  * **Weighted Graph**: Edges have associated values (weights), representing costs, distances, etc. (Not implemented in this code).
  * **Unweighted Graph**: Edges have no associated values. (Implemented in this code).

### 3\. Graph Representations

There are several ways to represent a graph:

  * **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array `matrix[N][N]` where `matrix[i][j] = 1` if an edge exists between `i` and `j`, else `0`.
      * **Pros**: Fast `O(1)` check for edge existence.
      * **Cons**: Space `O(N^2)`, even for sparse graphs (many vertices, few edges).
  * **Adjacency List**: An array or hash map where each index/key represents a vertex, and its value is a list of its neighbors.
      * **Pros**: Space `O(V + E)` (Vertices + Edges), efficient for sparse graphs.
      * **Cons**: `O(degree(V))` to check if an edge exists (need to iterate neighbors).
  * **Edge List**: Simply a list of all edges, where each edge is a pair `(u, v)`.

### 4\. Adjacency List Implementation (in provided code)

  * **Data Structure**: An `unordered_map<int, list<int>> adj` is used.
      * `int`: Represents a vertex (node ID).
      * `list<int>`: Represents the list of adjacent vertices (neighbors) for that key vertex. `std::list` is a doubly-linked list, `std::vector` or `std::set` could also be used depending on specific needs (e.g., `vector` for better cache locality, `set` for sorted unique neighbors). `unordered_map` is good because node IDs don't have to be contiguous.
  * **`addEdge(int u, int v, bool direction)`**:
      * Adds an edge between `u` and `v`.
      * If `direction == false` (undirected), it adds `v` to `u`'s list and `u` to `v`'s list.
      * If `direction == true` (directed), it only adds `v` to `u`'s list.
  * **`printAdjList()`**: Iterates through the `adj` map and prints each vertex along with its list of neighbors.

### 5\. Time and Space Complexity of Adjacency List

  * **Space Complexity**: `O(V + E)` where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges. This is because each vertex is stored once in the map, and each edge is stored once (for directed) or twice (for undirected) across all lists.
  * **Time Complexity**:
      * `addEdge()`: `O(1)` on average (for `unordered_map::operator[]` and `list::push_back`).
      * `printAdjList()`: `O(V + E)` because it visits each vertex and each edge once.

### 6\. Common Graph Algorithms (Building Blocks)

Once a graph is represented, common algorithms can be applied:

  * **Traversal**:
      * **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores layer by layer. Uses a queue.
      * **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Uses recursion or a stack.
  * **Pathfinding**: Dijkstra's, A\*, Bellman-Ford.
  * **Connectivity**: Connected components, strongly connected components.
  * **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Prim's, Kruskal's.
  * **Topological Sort**: For DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs).
