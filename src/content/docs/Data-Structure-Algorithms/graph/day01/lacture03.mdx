```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> // Includes common standard libraries like iostream, vector.
using namespace std;     // Use the standard namespace.

// Class to represent a Graph using an Adjacency Matrix.
class Graph {
public:
    // Adjacency Matrix representation:
    // A 2D vector where adjMat[i][j] == 1 means an edge exists from i to j, 0 otherwise.
    vector<vector<int>> adjMat;

    // Constructor for the Graph.
    // 'nodeCount': The total number of nodes (vertices) in the graph.

### 1\. What is a Graph?

  * A **Graph** is a non-linear data structure used to represent connections between entities.
  * **Vertices (Nodes)**: The individual entities (e.g., cities, people).
  * **Edges**: The connections between pairs of vertices (e.g., roads, friendships).

### 2\. Graph Representations Overview

There are several ways to store a graph in computer memory:

  * **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array (matrix) where `matrix[i][j]` indicates if an edge exists between vertex `i` and vertex `j`.
  * **Adjacency List**: An array or hash map where each index/key represents a vertex, and its value is a list of its neighbors.
  * **Edge List**: Simply a list of all edges, where each edge is a pair `(u, v)`.

### 3\. Adjacency Matrix Specifics

  * **Structure**: For a graph with `N` vertices, an `N x N` matrix is used.
  * **Interpretation**:
      * `adjMat[i][j] = 1` (or `true`) indicates an edge from vertex `i` to vertex `j`.
      * `adjMat[i][j] = 0` (or `false`) indicates no direct edge from `i` to `j`.
  * **For Undirected Graphs**: If `adjMat[i][j] = 1`, then `adjMat[j][i]` must also be `1` (symmetric matrix).
  * **For Directed Graphs**: `adjMat[i][j] = 1` does not imply `adjMat[j][i] = 1`.
  * **Weighted Graphs**: `adjMat[i][j]` could store the weight of the edge instead of just `1`. (This code implements an unweighted graph).

### 4\. Adjacency Matrix Implementation (in provided code)

  * **Data Structure**: `vector<vector<int>> adjMat;` is used. This dynamically sized 2D vector allows for `N x N` matrix creation.
  * **Constructor `Graph(int nodeCount)`**:
      * Initializes `adjMat` to an `nodeCount x nodeCount` matrix.
      * All elements are initially set to `0`, indicating no edges.
  * **`addEdge(int u, int v, bool direction)`**:
      * Sets `adjMat[u][v] = 1` to mark an edge from `u` to `v`.
      * If `direction == false` (undirected), it also sets `adjMat[v][u] = 1` to represent the edge in the reverse direction.
  * **`printAdjMatrix()`**:
      * Iterates through each row (`i`) and then each column (`j`) of the `adjMat`.
      * Prints the contents of the matrix, showing `0` or `1` for each possible connection.

### 5\. Time and Space Complexity of Adjacency Matrix

  * **Space Complexity**: `O(V^2)` where `V` is the number of vertices. This is because an `N x N` matrix requires `N^2` memory cells.
      * **Advantage**: Suitable for **dense graphs** (many edges).
      * **Disadvantage**: Wastes memory for **sparse graphs** (few edges), as most cells would be `0`.
  * **Time Complexity**:
      * **`addEdge()`**: `O(1)` (direct array access).
      * **Checking for edge `(u, v)`**: `O(1)` (direct `adjMat[u][v]` access).
      * **Iterating all neighbors of `u`**: `O(V)` (you have to check all `V` columns in row `u`).
      * **`printAdjMatrix()`**: `O(V^2)` (visits every cell in the matrix).
