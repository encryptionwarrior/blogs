using namespace std;     // Use the standard namespace.

// Function to detect a cycle in a DIRECTED graph using Kahn's Algorithm (BFS-based topological sort).
// 'n': Total number of nodes (vertices). Assumed to be 0-indexed (0 to n-1).
// 'edges': A vector of pairs, where each pair {u, v} represents a directed edge u -> v.
// Returns true if a cycle is detected, false otherwise.
bool detectCyclicInDirectedGraph(int n, vector<pair<int, int>> &edges) {
    // 1. Build Adjacency List and compute In-degrees.
    unordered_map<int, list<int>> adjList; // Adjacency list for the directed graph.
    vector<int> indegree(n, 0);            // Vector to store in-degree for each node, initialized to 0.

    // Populate the adjacency list and calculate in-degrees from the given edges.
    for(int i = 0; i < edges.size(); i++) {
        int u = edges[i].first;  // Source node.
        int v = edges[i].second; // Destination node.

        adjList[u].push_back(v); // Add directed edge u -> v.
        indegree[v]++;           // Increment in-degree of the destination node 'v'.
    }

    // 2. Initialize Queue with nodes having 0 in-degree.
    queue<int> qu; // Queue for BFS traversal.
    int count = 0; // Counter for nodes processed in topological order.

    // Enqueue all nodes that have an initial in-degree of 0.
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(indegree[i] == 0) {
            qu.push(i);
        }
    }

    // 3. Perform BFS-like traversal (Kahn's algorithm).
    while(!qu.empty()) {
        count++; // Increment the count of processed nodes.

        int frontVal = qu.front(); // Get the node from the front of the queue.
        qu.pop();                   // Remove it from the queue.

        // For each neighbor (x) of the current node (frontVal):
        // (i.e., for all nodes 'x' that 'frontVal' points to)
        for(int neighbor : adjList[frontVal]) {
            indegree[neighbor]--; // Decrement the in-degree of the neighbor.
                                  // This simulates removing the edge from 'frontVal' to 'neighbor'.

            // If the neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, it means all its prerequisites are met.
            if(indegree[neighbor] == 0) {
                qu.push(neighbor); // Enqueue the neighbor for processing.
            }
        }
    }

    // 4. Check for cycle.
    // If 'count' is equal to 'n', it means all nodes were successfully included in the topological sort.
    // This is only possible if the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
    // If 'count' is less than 'n', it implies that some nodes could not be processed (their in-degrees
    // never dropped to 0), indicating the presence of a cycle.
    return (count == n) ? false : true;

### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Determine if a **directed** graph contains any cycles.
  * **Input**: Number of nodes `n` and a list of directed edges `(u, v)` (meaning `u -> v`).
  * **Output**: `true` if a cycle is present, `false` otherwise.

### 2\. Core Idea (Kahn's Algorithm for Cycle Detection)

  * Kahn's algorithm is primarily used for Topological Sorting.
  * A topological sort is *only possible* for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
  * **Key Insight for Cycle Detection**: If a directed graph contains a cycle, it's impossible to perform a complete topological sort that includes *all* `N` vertices. This is because nodes within a cycle will always have an incoming edge (from within the cycle), meaning their in-degree will never drop to zero until other nodes in the cycle are processed, leading to a deadlock.
  * Therefore, if the number of nodes in the topological order generated by Kahn's algorithm is less than the total number of nodes `N` in the graph, it implies the presence of a cycle.

### 3\. Algorithm Steps (`detectCyclicInDirectedGraph` function)

1.  **Build Adjacency List & Calculate In-Degrees**:

      * Initialize an `adjList` (`unordered_map<int, list<int>>`) to represent the directed graph.
      * Initialize an `indegree` vector (`vector<int> indegree(n, 0)`) of size `n`, with all values set to `0`.
      * Iterate through each `edge (u, v)` in the input `edges`:
          * Add `v` to `adjList[u]` (representing `u -> v`).
          * Increment `indegree[v]` (because `v` has an incoming edge from `u`).

2.  **Initialize Queue**:

      * Create an empty `queue<int> qu`.
      * Iterate through all nodes from `0` to `n-1`.
      * If `indegree[i] == 0` for any node `i`, push `i` onto the `qu`. These are the initial nodes with no prerequisites.

3.  **Process Queue (BFS-like)**:

      * Initialize a `count` variable to `0`. This `count` will track the number of nodes successfully added to the topological order.
      * While `qu` is not empty:
          * Increment `count`.
          * `frontVal = qu.front(); qu.pop();` (Dequeue the current node).
          * For each `neighbor (x)` in `adjList[frontVal]` (i.e., for all nodes `x` that `frontVal` points to):
              * Decrement `indegree[x]`. (This simulates removing the edge `frontVal -> x`).
              * If `indegree[x]` becomes `0`, push `x` onto the `qu`. (It's now eligible for processing).

4.  **Check for Cycle**:

      * After the BFS-like process completes:
          * If `count == n` (meaning all `n` nodes were successfully processed and added to the topological order), then the graph is a DAG (no cycle). Return `false`.
          * If `count < n` (meaning some nodes were left behind because their in-degrees never reached zero), then a cycle exists. Return `true`.

### 4\. Time and Space Complexity

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * Building `adjList` and calculating `in-degrees`: `O(E)`.
      * Initial queue population: `O(V)`.
      * BFS traversal (processing queue): Each vertex is enqueued/dequeued once (`O(V)`), and each edge is processed once (`O(E)`).
      * Total: `O(V + E)`.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * `adjList`: `O(V + E)`.
      * `indegree` vector: `O(V)`.
      * `queue`: `O(V)` in the worst case.
