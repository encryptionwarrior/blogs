### 1\. What is Topological Sort?

  * **Topological Sort (or Topological Ordering)** is a linear ordering of vertices in a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** such that for every directed edge `u -> v`, vertex `u` comes before vertex `v` in the ordering.
  * **Key Constraint**: It is *only* possible for **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**. If a graph contains a cycle, a topological sort is not possible.
  * **Analogy**: Imagine a sequence of tasks where some tasks must be completed before others (dependencies). A topological sort gives a valid order to complete all tasks.

### 2\. Core Idea (DFS-based approach)

  * When performing a DFS, we explore a path as deep as possible.
  * If we push a node onto a stack *only after* all its adjacent nodes (and their sub-paths) have been completely explored, then when we pop elements from the stack, we will get the topological order.
  * **Why this works**: By pushing a node onto the stack *after* all its descendants are processed, we ensure that a node appears before any of its children in the final reversed order (which is the stack's pop order).

### 3\. Algorithm Steps (`solveDFS` function)

1.  **Parameters**: `adjList`, `st` (a `stack<int>` to store the topological order), `visited` (a `vector<bool>` to track visited nodes), `node` (current node).
2.  **Mark Visited**: Set `visited[node] = true`.
3.  **Explore Neighbors**: For each `neighbor` (`x`) in `adjList[node]`:
      * If `!visited[x]`, recursively call `solveDFS(adjList, st, visited, x)`. This ensures we visit all descendants first.
4.  **Push to Stack**: After all neighbors (and their subtrees) of `node` have been visited and processed, push `node` onto the `st`. This is the crucial step that creates the correct ordering when popped later.

### 4\. Overall Topological Sort (`topologicalSort` function)

1.  **Build Adjacency List**: Create `adjList` from the input `edges`. Remember, it's a directed graph, so only `adjList[u].push_back(v)` for `u -> v`.
2.  **Initialization**:
      * `solution`: A `vector<int>` to store the final topological order.
      * `st`: An empty `stack<int>`.
      * `visited`: A `vector<bool>` of size `v` (number of nodes), initialized to `false` (or `0`).
3.  **Iterate Through All Nodes**: Use a loop `for i = 0 to v-1`.
      * If `!visited[i]` (meaning node `i` hasn't been part of a previously explored component), start a DFS:
          * Call `solveDFS(adjList, st, visited, i)`.
4.  **Pop from Stack to Get Result**: After all DFS calls are complete and `st` is populated, pop elements from `st` one by one and add them to `solution`. The order of elements popped from the stack will be the topological order.

### 5\. Time and Space Complexity

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * Building `adjList`: `O(E)`.
      * `solveDFS`: Each vertex and edge is visited at most once. `O(V + E)`.
      * Populating `solution` from `st`: `O(V)`.
      * Total: `O(V + E)`.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * `adjList`: `O(V + E)`.
      * `visited` vector: `O(V)`.
      * `stack`: `O(V)` in the worst case (e.g., a long linear graph).

### 6\. Alternatives / Important Notes

  * **Kahn's Algorithm (BFS-based)**: Another common algorithm for topological sort, which uses in-degrees and a queue. Often preferred when detecting cycles is also a requirement, as it naturally identifies cycles (if the final sorted list doesn't contain all `V` nodes).
  * **Cycle Detection**: If the graph contains a cycle, topological sort is not possible. This DFS-based approach will still return an ordering, but it won't be a valid topological sort. You'd typically run a cycle detection algorithm first.
  * **Multiple Topological Orders**: A DAG can have multiple valid topological sorts. This algorithm provides one of them.
