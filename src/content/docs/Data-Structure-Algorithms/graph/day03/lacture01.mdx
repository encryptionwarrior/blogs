### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Determine if a **directed** graph contains any cycles.
  * **Input**: Number of nodes `n`, a list of directed edges `(u, v)` (meaning `u -> v`).
  * **Output**: `true` if a cycle is present, `false` otherwise.

### 2\. Core Idea for Directed Graphs with DFS

  * In a directed graph, simply encountering a `visited` node is not enough to declare a cycle (it might just be a forward edge to an already explored part of the graph).
  * We need two `visited` arrays (or sets):
      * `visited` array: Marks nodes that have been visited at least once during the entire DFS process (across all components).
      * `dfsVisited` array: Marks nodes that are currently in the **current DFS recursion stack** (i.e., part of the current path being explored).
  * **Cycle Condition**: A cycle is detected if, during a DFS traversal, we encounter a neighbor `x` of the current `Node` such that `x` is already marked as `dfsVisited`. This means we've found a back-edge to a node that is an ancestor in the current DFS path, thus forming a cycle.

### 3\. Algorithm Steps (`isCyclicDFS` function)

1.  **Parameters**: `adjList`, `visited` (global `vector<int>` or `bool` array), `dfsVisited` (current path `vector<int>` or `bool` array), `Node` (current node).
2.  **Mark Current Node**:
      * Set `visited[Node] = 1`.
      * Set `dfsVisited[Node] = 1`. (Marks this node as being in the current recursion stack).
3.  **Explore Neighbors**: For each `neighbor` (`x`) in `adjList[Node]`:
      * **Case 1: Unvisited Neighbor**: If `visited[x] == 0`:
          * Recursively call `isCyclicDFS(adjList, visited, dfsVisited, x)`.
          * If this recursive call returns `true` (a cycle was found deeper in that path), immediately `return true`.
      * **Case 2: Visited Neighbor AND in Current DFS Path**: If `visited[x] == 1` **AND** `dfsVisited[x] == 1`:
          * This is the critical condition for a cycle in a directed graph. We've found a back-edge to an ancestor.
          * `return true`.
4.  **Backtracking**: After exploring all neighbors of `Node` (and no cycle was found through them), remove `Node` from the current DFS path.
      * Set `dfsVisited[Node] = 0`. (Crucial\! This means `Node` is no longer in the *current* recursion stack, though it might still be `visited` overall).
5.  **No Cycle in Path**: If the loop finishes without returning `true`, it means no cycle was found through `Node` or its descendants in the current path. `return false`.

### 4\. Overall Cycle Detection (`detectCyclicInDirectedGraph` function)

  * **Adjacency List Creation**: First, build the `adjList` from the input `edges`. For directed graphs, only add `v` to `u`'s list (`u -> v`).
  * **Initialization of Visited Arrays**: Create `visited` and `dfsVisited` vectors of size `n`, initialized to `0` (false).
  * **Handling Disconnected Graphs**: Iterate through all possible nodes (`for i = 0 to n-1`, assuming 0-indexed nodes based on `visited` and `dfsVisited` vector sizes).
      * If a node `i` has not been `visited` yet:
          * Call `isCyclicDFS(adjList, visited, dfsVisited, i)`.
          * If `isCyclicDFS` returns `true`, then a cycle exists in the graph. Immediately `return true`.
  * **No Cycle Found**: If the loop completes and no cycle was detected in any component, return `false`.

### 5\. Time and Space Complexity

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * Building `adjList`: `O(M)` (where `M` is number of edges).
      * `isCyclicDFS`: Each vertex and edge is visited at most once. `O(V + E)`.
      * Outer loop in `detectCyclicInDirectedGraph`: Iterates `V` times, but `isCyclicDFS` only runs on unvisited components. So, the total work for all `isCyclicDFS` calls is `O(V + E)`.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * `adjList`: `O(V + E)`.
      * `visited` vector: `O(V)`.
      * `dfsVisited` vector: `O(V)`.
      * Recursion stack depth: `O(V)` in the worst case (e.g., a long linear graph).
