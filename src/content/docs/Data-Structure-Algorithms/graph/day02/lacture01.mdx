void traversal(unordered_map<int, list<int>> &adjList, unordered_map<int, bool> &visited,
               vector<int> &answer, int node) {
    queue<int> Q; // Create a queue for BFS.

    Q.push(node);          // Push the starting node into the queue.
    visited[node] = 1;     // Mark the starting node as visited. (Important: mark when enqueued!)

    // Loop continues as long as there are nodes in the queue to process.
    while(!Q.empty()) {
        int frontVal = Q.front(); // Get the node at the front of the queue.
        Q.pop();                   // Remove the front node from the queue.

        // The line below 'visited[frontVal] = true;' is redundant if marked when pushed.
        // It's generally better to mark visited when pushing to the queue to avoid adding duplicates.
        // For correctness, the check 'if(!visited[i])' inside the loop is key.
        // visited[frontVal] = true; // Mark the node as visited (already marked when pushed).

        answer.push_back(frontVal); // Add the processed node to the answer list.

        // Explore all neighbors of the current node (frontVal).

### 1\. What is BFS?

  * **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the nodes at the present depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
  * It systematically explores a graph to discover its structure.
  * **Analogy**: Imagine ripples expanding from a stone dropped in water. BFS explores nodes level by level, like these expanding ripples.

### 2\. Key Characteristics & Use Cases

  * **Level-by-Level Exploration**: Visits all neighbors of a node before moving to their neighbors.
  * **Shortest Path on Unweighted Graphs**: BFS finds the shortest path (in terms of number of edges) from a source node to all other reachable nodes in an **unweighted graph**.
  * **Finding Connected Components**: Can be used to identify all nodes reachable from a given source, thus finding a connected component.
  * **Cycle Detection**: Can detect cycles in undirected graphs.
  * **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Not directly for MST, but building blocks for other algorithms.

### 3\. Algorithm Steps

1.  **Initialization**:

      * **Adjacency List (`adjList`)**: Represents the graph. `unordered_map<int, list<int>>` is common.
      * **Visited Array (`visited`)**: A boolean array or hash map (e.g., `unordered_map<int, bool>`) to keep track of visited nodes to prevent cycles and redundant processing. Initialize all to `false` (or `0`).
      * **Queue (`Q`)**: A standard queue data structure, essential for level-by-level traversal.
      * **Result (`answer`)**: A vector to store the nodes in the order they are visited.

2.  **Starting Traversal (`traversal` function)**:

      * Pick a starting `node`.
      * **Enqueue**: Push the `node` into the `Q`.
      * **Mark Visited**: Mark `node` as `visited[node] = true`.
      * **Loop**: While the `Q` is not empty:
          * **Dequeue**: Get the `frontVal` from the `Q` and remove it (`pop`).
          * **Process Node**: Add `frontVal` to the `answer` list (or perform other operations).
          * **Explore Neighbors**: For each `neighbor` of `frontVal` (iterating through `adjList[frontVal]`):
              * If `neighbor` has not been `visited` yet:
                  * **Enqueue**: Push `neighbor` into the `Q`.
                  * **Mark Visited**: Mark `neighbor` as `visited[neighbor] = true`. (Crucial to mark *when enqueued* to avoid duplicates in queue).

3.  **Handling Disconnected Graphs (`BFS` function)**:

      * A single call to `traversal` explores only one connected component.
      * To ensure all nodes in a potentially disconnected graph are visited, iterate through all possible nodes (`for i = 0 to vertex-1`).
      * If `visited[i]` is `false` (meaning node `i` hasn't been part of any previously explored component), start a new `traversal` from `i`.

### 4\. Time and Space Complexity

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)` where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges.
      * Each vertex is enqueued and dequeued at most once (`O(V)`).
      * Each edge is examined at most twice (once for each direction in an undirected graph) when iterating through adjacency lists (`O(E)`).
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(V)`
      * `adjList`: `O(V + E)` for graph storage, but this is input structure.
      * `visited` map/array: `O(V)`.
      * `Queue`: In the worst case (e.g., a star graph), the queue can hold up to `O(V)` nodes.

### 5\. Implementation Details / Common Pitfalls

  * **Visited Array/Map**: Essential to prevent infinite loops in graphs with cycles and to correctly mark processed nodes. Mark a node as visited *when you add it to the queue*, not when you process it. The provided code marks when added to queue and also inside while loop, but marking when enqueued is sufficient and standard.
  * **Adjacency List Creation**: The `BFS` function takes an `edges` list and builds the `adjList` internally.
  * **Node IDs**: Assumes node IDs are integers, typically 0-indexed or arbitrary integers handled by `unordered_map`.
