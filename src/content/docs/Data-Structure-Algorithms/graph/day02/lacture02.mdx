### 1\. What is DFS?

  * **Depth-First Search (DFS)** is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before *backtracking*.
  * It's like exploring a maze: you pick a path and keep going until you hit a dead end, then you go back to the last branching point and try another path.

### 2\. Key Characteristics & Use Cases

  * **Stack-based/Recursive Exploration**: DFS naturally uses a stack (or recursion, which uses the call stack) to keep track of the path to backtrack.
  * **Finding Connected Components**: A single DFS run from an unvisited node will visit all nodes in its connected component. The provided code leverages this to find all components.
  * **Cycle Detection**: Can detect cycles in both directed and undirected graphs.
  * **Topological Sorting**: Essential for ordering tasks in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
  * **Path Finding**: Can find a path between two nodes (though not necessarily the shortest).

### 3\. Algorithm Steps

1.  **Initialization**:

      * **Adjacency List (`adjList`)**: Represents the graph (`unordered_map<int, list<int>>`).
      * **Visited Array (`visited`)**: A boolean map (`unordered_map<int, bool>`) to keep track of visited nodes. Initialize all to `false` (or `0`).
      * **Result (`answer`)**: A `vector<vector<int>>` to store separate connected components found. Each inner `vector<int>` will be a component.

2.  **Recursive Traversal (`traversal` function)**:

      * **Parameters**: `adjList`, `visited`, `component` (vector to build the current connected component), `node` (current node being visited).
      * **Mark Visited & Add to Component**:
          * Add `node` to the current `component` list.
          * Mark `node` as `visited[node] = true`.
      * **Explore Neighbors**: For each `neighbor` (`i`) in `adjList[node]`:
          * **If Not Visited**: If `!visited[i]`, recursively call `traversal(adjList, visited, component, i)`. This moves deeper into the graph.

3.  **Handling Disconnected Graphs (`DFS` function)**:

      * The main `DFS` function iterates through all possible nodes (`for i = 0 to V-1`).
      * If `visited[i]` is `false` (meaning node `i` hasn't been part of any previously explored component):
          * Create a new empty `component` vector.
          * Start a DFS `traversal` from `i`.
          * After the `traversal` call returns, `component` will contain all nodes of that connected component. Add this `component` to the `answer` list.

### 4\. Time and Space Complexity

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)` where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges.
      * Each vertex is visited once.
      * Each edge is traversed at most twice (once for each direction in an undirected graph) when exploring neighbors.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * `adjList`: `O(V + E)` for graph storage (input).
      * `visited` map: `O(V)`.
      * Recursion stack depth: `O(V)` in the worst case (e.g., a long linear graph), as it could go `V` levels deep.
      * `answer` vector of vectors: `O(V + E)` in total, as it stores all nodes and implicitly edges (via their connections).

### 5\. Comparison with BFS

| Feature      | DFS                                     | BFS                                   |
| :----------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **Data Structure** | Stack (Implicit via recursion)          | Queue                                 |
| **Traversal Order** | Deepest nodes first, then backtrack     | Level by level                        |
| **Shortest Path (Unweighted)** | No guarantee (finds *a* path)   | Guaranteed shortest path (in edges)   |
| **Applications** | Topological sort, cycle detection, strongly connected components | Shortest path (unweighted), network broadcasting, finding connected components |
