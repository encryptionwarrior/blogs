### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Determine if an undirected graph contains any cycles.
  * **Input**: Number of nodes `n`, number of edges `m`, and a list of edges `(u, v)`.
  * **Output**: "YES" if a cycle is present, "NO" otherwise.

### 2\. Core Idea for Undirected Graphs with DFS

  * When performing a DFS traversal, we explore as deep as possible. We need to keep track of the `parent` node from which we arrived at the current node.
  * If, during the DFS, we encounter a `visited` neighbor (`i`) of the current `Node` that is *not* the `parent` of `Node`, it implies a back-edge forming a cycle.
      * **Why?** In an undirected graph, an edge `(U, V)` means `U` is a neighbor of `V`, and `V` is a neighbor of `U`. When we traverse `U -> V`, `U` becomes the `parent` of `V`. If `V` also sees `U` as a neighbor, it should recognize `U` as its `parent` and not flag it as a cycle. However, if `V` sees another `visited` neighbor `W` (that is not its `parent`), it means `W` was visited through a different path, forming a cycle.

### 3\. Algorithm Steps (`isCyclicDFS` function)

1.  **Parameters**: `adjList`, `visited` (global tracking), `Node` (current node), `parent` (the node from which `Node` was visited).
2.  **Mark Visited**: Set `visited[Node] = true`.
3.  **Explore Neighbors**: For each `neighbor` (`i`) in `adjList[Node]`:
      * **Case 1: Unvisited Neighbor**: If `visited[i] == false`:
          * Recursively call `isCyclicDFS(adjList, visited, i, Node)`.
          * If this recursive call returns `true` (a cycle was found deeper in that path), immediately `return true`.
      * **Case 2: Visited Neighbor AND not Parent**: If `visited[i] == true` **AND** `i != parent`:
          * A cycle is detected. This `neighbor` was already visited, and it's not the immediate parent in the current DFS path, indicating a back-edge to an already explored part of the graph.
          * `return true`.
4.  **No Cycle in Path**: If the loop finishes without returning `true`, it means no cycle was found through `Node` or its descendants. `return false`.

### 4\. Overall Cycle Detection (`cycleDetection` function)

  * **Adjacency List Creation**: First, build the `adjList` from the input `edges`. For undirected graphs, add edges `u->v` and `v->u`.
  * **Handling Disconnected Graphs**: Iterate through all possible nodes (`for i = 1 to n`, assuming 1-indexed nodes).
      * If a node `i` has not been `visited` yet (meaning it's part of a new connected component):
          * Call `isCyclicDFS(adjList, visited, i, -1)`. The `parent` for the starting node of a component is typically `-1` (a sentinel value).
          * If `isCyclicDFS` returns `true`, then a cycle exists in the graph. Immediately return "YES".
  * **No Cycle Found**: If the loop completes and no cycle was detected in any component, return "NO".

### 5\. Time and Space Complexity

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * Building `adjList`: `O(M)`.
      * `isCyclicDFS`: Each vertex and edge is visited at most once. `O(V + E)`.
      * Outer loop in `cycleDetection`: Iterates `V` times, but `isCyclicDFS` only runs on unvisited components. So, the total work for all `isCyclicDFS` calls is `O(V + E)`.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * `adjList`: `O(V + E)`.
      * `visited` map: `O(V)`.
      * Recursion stack depth: `O(V)` in the worst case (e.g., a long linear graph), as it could go `V` levels deep.
