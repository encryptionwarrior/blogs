        // Iterate through all neighbors of the current node.

            // Case 1: Neighbor is already visited.
            // If the visited neighbor is NOT the parent of the current node, then a cycle is found.
            // This means we found a path to 'neighbor' that doesn't go through 'FrontVal's parent.

                return true; // Cycle detected!

### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Determine if an undirected graph contains any cycles.
  * **Input**: Number of nodes `n`, number of edges `m`, and a list of edges `(u, v)`.
  * **Output**: "YES" if a cycle is present, "NO" otherwise.

### 2\. What is a Cycle?

  * A **cycle** in a graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, and where no vertex (other than the start/end vertex) is visited more than once.

### 3\. Core Idea for Undirected Graphs with BFS

  * When performing a BFS traversal, we keep track of the `parent` of each visited node.
  * If, during the BFS, we encounter a `visited` node that is *not* the current node's immediate `parent`, it means we've found a back-edge, which indicates a cycle.
      * **Why?** If a neighbor `V` of current node `U` is already `visited` and `V` is *not* the `parent` from which `U` was reached, it implies there's another path from the source to `V` that doesn't go through `U`'s parent. This forms a closed loop.

### 4\. Algorithm Steps (`isCyclicBFS` function)

1.  **Initialization**:

      * **`adjList`**: Adjacency list of the graph.
      * **`visited`**: `unordered_map<int, bool>` to mark visited nodes.
      * **`parent`**: `unordered_map<int, int>` to store the parent of each node in the BFS tree.
      * **Queue (`Q`)**: For BFS traversal.
      * **Start Node**: Push the `Node` (the current component's starting point) into `Q`.
      * **Mark Visited & Parent**: `visited[Node] = true; parent[Node] = -1;` (Parent of source is typically -1 or some sentinel).

2.  **BFS Loop**: While `Q` is not empty:

      * **Dequeue**: Get `FrontVal` from `Q` and `pop` it.
      * **Explore Neighbors**: For each `neighbor` (`i`) in `adjList[FrontVal]`:
          * **Cycle Condition**: If `neighbor` is `visited` **AND** `neighbor` is *not* the `parent` of `FrontVal`:
              * A cycle is detected. Return `true`.
          * **Unvisited Neighbor**: If `neighbor` is `not visited`:
              * Mark `visited[neighbor] = true`.
              * Set `parent[neighbor] = FrontVal`.
              * Enqueue `neighbor`.

3.  **No Cycle in Component**: If the BFS loop finishes without returning `true`, it means no cycle was found in the current connected component. Return `false`.

### 5\. Overall Cycle Detection (`cycleDetection` function)

  * **Adjacency List Creation**: First, build the `adjList` from the input `edges`. For undirected graphs, add edges `u->v` and `v->u`.
  * **Handling Disconnected Graphs**: Iterate through all possible nodes (`for i = 1 to n`).
      * If a node `i` has not been `visited` yet (meaning it's part of a new connected component):
          * Call `isCyclicBFS(adjList, visited, i)`.
          * If `isCyclicBFS` returns `true`, then a cycle exists in the graph. Immediately return "YES".
  * **No Cycle Found**: If the loop completes and no cycle was detected in any component, return "NO".

### 6\. Time and Space Complexity

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * Building `adjList`: `O(M)` (where `M` is number of edges).
      * `isCyclicBFS`: Each vertex and edge is visited at most once. `O(V + E)`.
      * Outer loop in `cycleDetection`: Iterates `V` times, but `isCyclicBFS` only runs on unvisited components. So, total sum of `isCyclicBFS` calls across all components is `O(V + E)`.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * `adjList`: `O(V + E)`.
      * `visited` map: `O(V)`.
      * `parent` map: `O(V)`.
      * `Queue`: `O(V)` in worst case.
