### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Identify all "bridges" (also known as "cut edges") in a given undirected graph.
  * **Bridge Definition**: An edge in a connected graph whose removal increases the number of connected components. In other words, an edge is a bridge if its removal disconnects the graph (or its component).
  * **Input**: List of `edges (u, v)`, total `n` nodes, total `m` edges.
  * **Output**: A list of pairs, where each pair `[u, v]` represents a bridge edge.

### 2\. Core Idea (Tarjan's Algorithm / DFS-based)

The algorithm uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal and maintains two important arrays for each node:

  * **`disc[node]` (Discovery Time)**: The time (or order) at which a node `node` was first visited during the DFS traversal.
  * **`low[node]` (Lowest Ancestor Time)**: The lowest discovery time reachable from `node` (including `node` itself) through any path, including back-edges (edges to already visited ancestors).

**The Bridge Condition**: An edge `(u, v)` (where `v` is a child of `u` in the DFS tree) is a bridge if and only if `low[v] > disc[u]`.
This condition means that the subtree rooted at `v` has no back-edge to `u` or any ancestor of `u`. Therefore, removing the edge `(u, v)` would disconnect `v` and its subtree from `u` and the rest of the graph.

### 3\. Algorithm Steps (`findBridges` and `dfs` functions)

#### A. `findBridges` Function (Main Wrapper)

1.  **Build Adjacency List**:

      * Create an `adjList` (`unordered_map<int, list<int>>`) from the input `edges`.
      * For each edge `(u, v)`, add `v` to `adjList[u]` and `u` to `adjList[v]` (undirected graph).

2.  **Initialize Data Structures**:

      * `timer = 0`: A global counter to assign discovery times.
      * `disc[n]`: `vector<int>` initialized to `-1`. Stores discovery times.
      * `low[n]`: `vector<int>` initialized to `-1`. Stores lowest reachable ancestor times.
      * `parent = -1`: Special value for the parent of the initial DFS call's root.
      * `visited[n]`: `vector<bool>` initialized to `false`. To track visited nodes.
      * `result`: `vector<vector<int>>` to store the identified bridge edges.

3.  **Initiate DFS for all components**:

      * Loop through all nodes `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
      * If `!visited[i]`, it means `i` is part of an unvisited component. Start DFS from `i`:
          * `dfs(i, parent, timer, disc, low, result, adjList, visited);`

4.  **Return**: The `result` vector containing all bridge edges.

#### B. `dfs` Function (Recursive Traversal)

  * **Parameters**: `node` (current node), `parent` (parent of `node` in DFS tree), `timer`, `disc`, `low`, `result`, `adjList`, `visited`.

  * **Base Actions (on entering node)**:

    1.  `visited[node] = true;` (Mark current node as visited).
    2.  `disc[node] = low[node] = timer++;` (Set discovery and low times, then increment timer).

  * **Explore Neighbors**: For each `neigh` in `adjList[node]`:

    1.  **Skip Parent**: `if (neigh == parent) continue;` (Don't process the edge back to the immediate parent, as it's not a true back-edge for cycle detection from `neigh`'s perspective).

    2.  **If `neigh` is NOT visited (`visited[neigh] == false`)**: (Forward edge to an unvisited child)

          * Recursively call `dfs(neigh, node, timer, disc, low, result, adjList, visited);`
          * **After recursive call returns (from child `neigh`)**:
              * `low[node] = min(low[node], low[neigh]);` (Update `low[node]` with `low[neigh]`. This means `node` can reach whatever `neigh` can reach).
              * **Bridge Check**: `if (low[neigh] > disc[node])`:
                  * This is the critical condition. If `low[neigh]` (lowest reachable discovery time from `neigh`'s subtree) is greater than `disc[node]` (discovery time of its parent `node`), it means there's no back-edge from `neigh`'s subtree to `node` or any ancestor of `node`. Thus, `(node, neigh)` is a bridge.
                  * `result.push_back({node, neigh});` (Add this bridge to the result).

    3.  **If `neigh` IS visited (`visited[neigh] == true`)**: (Back edge to an already visited ancestor, or cross edge)

          * `low[node] = min(low[node], disc[neigh]);` (Update `low[node]` with `disc[neigh]`. This indicates that `node` can reach an already visited node (`neigh`) directly, which might be an ancestor and thus part of a cycle. `disc[neigh]` is used because `neigh` is an ancestor, and its `disc` value is its earliest time).

### 4\. Time and Space Complexity

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * Building `adjList`: `O(M)`.
      * DFS traversal: Each vertex and edge is visited exactly once. `O(V + E)`.
      * Total: `O(V + E)`.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * `adjList`: `O(V + E)`.
      * `disc`, `low`, `visited` arrays: `O(V)`.
      * Recursion stack for DFS: `O(V)` in worst case (skewed graph).
      * `result` vector: `O(E)` in worst case (a tree has `V-1` bridges).

### 5\. Key Points / Intuition

  * `disc[u]` tells us "when `u` was first discovered".
  * `low[u]` tells us "the highest point (lowest discovery time) that `u` or any node in `u`'s DFS subtree can reach using at most one back-edge".
  * If `low[v] > disc[u]` for an edge `(u, v)` where `v` is a child of `u` in the DFS tree, it means `v` and its entire subtree have no way to reach `u` or any of `u`'s ancestors except through the edge `(u, v)` itself. Hence, `(u, v)` is a bridge.
