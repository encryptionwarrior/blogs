### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Identify all "articulation points" (also known as "cut vertices") in a given undirected graph.
  * **Articulation Point Definition**: A vertex (node) in a connected graph whose removal (along with all incident edges) increases the number of connected components. In simpler terms, it's a critical node that, if removed, would disconnect a part of the graph.
  * **Input**: List of `edges (u, v)`, total `n` nodes, total `m` edges.
  * **Output**: A list of integers, where each integer represents an articulation point.

### 2\. Core Idea (Tarjan's Algorithm / DFS-based)

Similar to finding bridges, this algorithm uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal and maintains two important arrays for each node:

  * **`disc[node]` (Discovery Time)**: The time (or order) at which a node `node` was first visited during the DFS traversal.
  * **`low[node]` (Lowest Ancestor Time)**: The lowest discovery time reachable from `node` (including `node` itself) through any path, including back-edges (edges to already visited ancestors).

**The Articulation Point Conditions**: A node `u` is an articulation point if:

1.  **Case 1: `u` is the DFS root** (i.e., `parent == -1` for `u` in the `dfs` call)

      * And `u` has at least two independent children in the DFS tree (`child > 1`). Independent means their subtrees don't share any common nodes other than `u`. If `u` is removed, these children and their subtrees would become disconnected from each other.

2.  **Case 2: `u` is NOT the DFS root**

      * And there exists at least one child `v` of `u` in the DFS tree such that `low[v] >= disc[u]`.
      * This means that the subtree rooted at `v` (including `v`) cannot reach any ancestor of `u` (or `u` itself) without going through `u`. If `u` is removed, `v` and its entire subtree would become disconnected from the rest of the graph.

### 3\. Algorithm Steps (`cutVertex` and `dfs` functions)

#### A. `cutVertex` Function (Main Wrapper)

1.  **Build Adjacency List**:

      * Create an `adjList` (`unordered_map<int, list<int>>`) from the input `edges`.
      * For each edge `(u, v)`, add `v` to `adjList[u]` and `u` to `adjList[v]` (undirected graph).

2.  **Initialize Data Structures**:

      * `timer = 0`: A global counter for discovery times.
      * `disc[n]`: `vector<int>` initialized to `-1`. Stores discovery times.
      * `low[n]`: `vector<int>` initialized to `-1`. Stores lowest reachable ancestor times.
      * `parent = -1`: Special value for the parent of the initial DFS call's root.
      * `visited[n]`: `vector<bool>` initialized to `false`. To track visited nodes.
      * `result`: `vector<int>` to store the identified articulation points. Note: For articulation points, it's common to use a `vector<bool> isArticulationPoint(n, false)` to avoid duplicates if a node qualifies multiple times, then collect results. The current code adds duplicates.

3.  **Initiate DFS for all components**:

      * Loop through all nodes `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
      * If `!visited[i]`, it means `i` is part of an unvisited component. Start DFS from `i`:
          * `dfs(i, parent, timer, disc, low, result, adjList, visited);`

4.  **Return**: The `result` vector containing all articulation points (may contain duplicates if a node qualifies multiple times). Sorting and removing duplicates is recommended.

#### B. `dfs` Function (Recursive Traversal)

  * **Parameters**: `node` (current node), `parent` (parent of `node` in DFS tree), `timer`, `disc`, `low`, `result`, `adjList`, `visited`.

  * **Local Variable**: `int child = 0;` (Counts the number of children in the DFS tree for the current `node`).

  * **Base Actions (on entering node)**:

    1.  `visited[node] = true;` (Mark current node as visited).
    2.  `disc[node] = low[node] = timer++;` (Set discovery time and initial low-link value, then increment timer).

  * **Explore Neighbors**: For each `neigh` in `adjList[node]`:

    1.  **Skip Parent**: `if (neigh == parent) continue;` (Crucial: avoids considering the edge back to the immediate parent).

    2.  **If `neigh` is NOT visited (`visited[neigh] == false`)**: (Forward edge to an unvisited child)

          * Increment `child++;`
          * Recursively call `dfs(neigh, node, timer, disc, low, result, adjList, visited);`
          * **After recursive call returns (from child `neigh`)**:
              * `low[node] = min(low[node], low[neigh]);` (Update `low[node]` with `low[neigh]`. This means `node` can reach whatever `neigh` can reach).
              * **Articulation Point Condition (Case 2)**: `if (low[neigh] >= disc[node] && parent != -1)`:
                  * If `low[neigh]` (lowest reachable discovery time from `neigh`'s subtree) is greater than or equal to `disc[node]` (discovery time of its parent `node`), and `node` is not the DFS root. This means `neigh`'s subtree (including `neigh`) cannot reach any node *above* `node` without passing through `node`. So, `node` is an articulation point.
                  * `result.push_back(node);` (Add `node` to the result).

    3.  **If `neigh` IS visited (`visited[neigh] == true`)**: (Back edge to an already visited ancestor, or cross edge)

          * `low[node] = min(low[node], disc[neigh]);` (Update `low[node]` with `disc[neigh]`. This indicates that `node` can reach an already visited node (`neigh`) directly, which might be an ancestor and thus part of a cycle).

  * **Special Case: Checking for Starting Node (DFS Root)**:

      * `if (parent == -1 && child > 1)`:
          * After exploring all neighbors, if `node` was the root of the DFS tree (`parent == -1`), and it has more than one child in the DFS tree, then `node` is an articulation point. Its removal would disconnect its children's subtrees.
          * `result.push_back(node);`

### 4\. Time and Space Complexity

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * Building `adjList`: `O(M)`.
      * DFS traversal: Each vertex and edge is visited exactly once. `O(V + E)`.
      * Sorting `result` (in `main`): `O(A log A)` where `A` is number of articulation points (max `V`).
      * Total: `O(V + E)`.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * `adjList`: `O(V + E)`.
      * `disc`, `low`, `visited` arrays: `O(V)`.
      * Recursion stack for DFS: `O(V)` in worst case (skewed graph).
      * `result` vector: `O(V)` in worst case.

### 5\. Key Points / Intuition

  * **`low[node] >= disc[parent]` vs `low[v] > disc[u]`**:

      * For **articulation points**, we use `low[child] >= disc[current_node]`. The equality `low[child] == disc[current_node]` means the child's subtree can only reach up to `current_node` via a back-edge. If `current_node` is removed, this path is cut.
      * For **bridges**, we use `low[child] > disc[current_node]`. If `low[child]` is strictly greater, it means there's *no* path from `child`'s subtree that bypasses `current_node`.

  * **Handling DFS Root**: The root of a DFS tree is an articulation point only if it has at least two children in the DFS tree. This is because removing the root would disconnect these children's subtrees from each other. If it has only one child (or none), removing it just removes that branch, but doesn't increase component count among other existing branches.
