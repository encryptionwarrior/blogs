// in a weighted graph that can contain negative edge weights, using Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
// It also detects negative cycles.
// 'edges': A vector of vectors, where each inner vector {u, v, w} represents a directed edge u -> v with weight w.
// 'n': Total number of nodes (vertices). Assumed to be 0-indexed (0 to n-1).
// 'm': Total number of edges.
// 'src': The source node from which to find shortest paths.
// Returns a vector containing the shortest distances from 'src' to all nodes.
// If a negative cycle is detected, it returns a vector with all INT_MAX.

    // Phase 1: Relax all edges N-1 times.

    // because a simple path in a graph with N vertices has at most N-1 edges.

### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Find the shortest path (minimum total weight) from a given `source` node to all other reachable nodes in a **weighted graph**.
  * **Key Feature**: Unlike Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford **can handle negative edge weights**.
  * **Negative Cycle Detection**: It can also detect if the graph contains a **negative cycle** reachable from the source node. If a negative cycle is present, shortest paths are undefined (can go infinitely negative).
  * **Input**: List of weighted `edges (u, v, w)` (directed edges `u -> v` with weight `w`), total `n` nodes, total `m` edges, `src` (source node).
  * **Output**: A vector `distance` where `distance[i]` is the shortest path distance from `src` to node `i`. If a negative cycle is detected, it typically returns a special value (e.g., a vector filled with `INT_MAX` as in this code, or a boolean flag). `INT_MAX` indicates unreachable or part of a negative cycle.

### 2\. Core Idea

The Bellman-Ford algorithm works on the principle of **relaxation**. It iteratively relaxes all edges in the graph `N-1` times.

  * **Relaxation**: For an edge `(u, v)` with weight `w`, if `distance[u] + w < distance[v]`, it means a shorter path to `v` has been found through `u`. In this case, `distance[v]` is updated.
  * **Why `N-1` iterations?**: In a graph with `N` nodes and no negative cycles, the longest simple path (a path that does not repeat any vertex) can have at most `N-1` edges. Therefore, after `N-1` iterations, all shortest paths (if they exist) will have been found. Each iteration guarantees that at least one more node's shortest path distance is finalized, if a shorter path exists through one more edge.
  * **Negative Cycle Detection**: After `N-1` iterations, if we can still relax any edge (i.e., `distance[u] + w < distance[v]` holds for any edge), it implies the presence of a negative cycle reachable from the source. This is because if there were no negative cycles, all shortest paths would have been finalized by then. Any further relaxation indicates a path that can be made infinitely shorter by traversing a negative cycle.

### 3\. Algorithm Steps (`shortestPath` function)

1.  **Initialize Distance Array**:

      * `vector<int> distance(n, INT_MAX);` All distances are initialized to `INT_MAX` (representing infinity).
      * `distance[src] = 0;` The distance from the source to itself is 0.

2.  **Relax Edges `N-1` Times**:

      * Outer loop `for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)`: This loop runs `n-1` times.
      * Inner loop `for (int j = 0; j < m; j++)`: Iterates through all `m` edges in the graph.
          * Get `u = edges[j][0]`, `v = edges[j][1]`, `w = edges[j][2]`.
          * **Relaxation Step**: `if (distance[u] != INT_MAX && distance[u] + w < distance[v])` (The `distance[u] != INT_MAX` check is crucial to prevent overflow if `distance[u]` is infinity and `w` is negative).
              * `distance[v] = distance[u] + w;` (Update `distance[v]` if a shorter path is found).

3.  **Detect Negative Cycles (Nth Iteration)**:

      * After `N-1` iterations, perform one more pass over all edges.
      * Outer loop `for (int j = 0; j < m; j++)`: Iterates through all `m` edges.
          * Get `u = edges[j][0]`, `v = edges[j][1]`, `w = edges[j][2]`.
          * **Check for further relaxation**: `if (distance[u] != INT_MAX && distance[u] + w < distance[v])`
              * If this condition is true for *any* edge, it means a negative cycle is reachable from the source.
              * `return vector<int>(n, INT_MAX);` (Return a vector indicating infinite paths, or throw an exception, or set a flag). The current code returns `INT_MAX` for all nodes, implying paths are undefined.

4.  **Return**: The `distance` vector containing the shortest path distances from `src` to all reachable nodes.

### 4\. Time and Space Complexity

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(V * E)`
      * The outer loop runs `V-1` times.
      * The inner loop iterates through all `E` edges in each iteration.
      * Total: `(V-1) * E`, which is **`O(V * E)`**.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * `distance` vector: `O(V)`.
      * Storing `edges`: `O(E)`.
      * Total: **`O(V + E)`**.

### 5\. Important Notes

  * **Directed Graphs**: Bellman-Ford is typically applied to directed graphs. For undirected graphs with negative weights, an undirected edge `(u, v, w)` is usually represented as two directed edges `(u -> v, w)` and `(v -> u, w)`. However, this can introduce negative cycles where none existed in an undirected context, so care is needed.
  * **Negative Cycles**: The ability to detect negative cycles is a key advantage over Dijkstra's. If a negative cycle is detected, shortest paths involving that cycle are undefined (can be arbitrarily small).
  * **Reachability**: Nodes that are unreachable from the source will retain their `INT_MAX` distance.
  * **All-Pairs Shortest Path**: For all-pairs shortest paths in graphs with negative weights, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm can be used.
