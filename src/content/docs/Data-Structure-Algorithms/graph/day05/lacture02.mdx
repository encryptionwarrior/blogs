// This function is empty in the provided code. It is typically where Prim's algorithm
// would be implemented. Given the DSU functions, it suggests Kruskal's algorithm,
// which uses DSU for cycle detection in MST construction.
vector<pair<pair<int, int>, int>> calculatePrimsMST(vector<vector<int>> &edges, int n, int m) {
    // This function is not implemented in the provided snippet.
    // It would contain the logic for Prim's MST algorithm.
    // However, the DSU functions below are typically used for Kruskal's MST algorithm
    // or other graph problems involving connected components/cycle detection.

    // For Kruskal's, this function would:
    // 1. Sort 'edges' by weight.
    // 2. Initialize DSU.
    // 3. Iterate through sorted edges:
    //    a. If parent[u] != parent[v] (no cycle formed):
    //       i. Add edge to MST result.
    //       ii. Union u and v.
    // 4. Return MST edges.

### 1\. What is Disjoint Set Union (DSU)?

  * **Purpose**: A data structure that manages a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets. It efficiently performs two main operations:
      * **`find`**: Determines which set an element belongs to (finds the representative/root of that set).
      * **`union`**: Merges two sets into a single set.
  * **Applications**:
      * Kruskal's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).
      * Detecting cycles in undirected graphs.
      * Connected components in a graph.
      * Network connectivity problems.

### 2\. Core Idea

Each set is represented as a tree structure. The root of each tree is the "representative" of its set.

  * **`parent` array**: `parent[i]` stores the parent of element `i`. If `parent[i] == i`, then `i` is the root of its set.
  * **`rank` (or `size`) array**: Used for optimization during union.
      * `rank[i]` (by rank/height): Stores the approximate height of the tree rooted at `i`.
      * `size[i]` (by size): Stores the number of elements in the set rooted at `i`.

### 3\. Key Operations

#### A. `findParent(vector<int> &parent, int node)`

  * **Purpose**: Finds the representative (root) of the set containing `node`.
  * **Recursive Approach**:
      * **Base Case**: If `parent[node] == node`, then `node` is the root, so return `node`.
      * **Recursive Step**: Otherwise, recursively call `findParent` on `parent[node]` to go up the tree.
  * **Path Compression Optimization**: During the recursive calls, assign the returned root directly to `parent[node]`. This flattens the tree, making future `find` operations for nodes in that path much faster.
      * `return parent[node] = findParent(parent, parent[node]);`

#### B. `unionSet(int u, int v, vector<int> &parent, vector<int> &rank)`

  * **Purpose**: Merges the sets containing `u` and `v`.
  * **Steps**:
    1.  Find the representatives (roots) of `u` and `v`: `rootU = findParent(parent, u)` and `rootV = findParent(parent, v)`.
    2.  If `rootU == rootV`, they are already in the same set; do nothing.
    3.  Otherwise, merge the two sets using **Union by Rank (or Size)** optimization:
          * **Union by Rank**: Attach the root of the shorter tree to the root of the taller tree. This keeps the overall tree height small.
              * If `rank[rootU] < rank[rootV]`, make `rootV` the parent of `rootU` (`parent[rootU] = rootV`).
              * If `rank[rootV] < rank[rootU]`, make `rootU` the parent of `rootV` (`parent[rootV] = rootU`).
              * If `rank[rootU] == rank[rootV]`, make one the parent of the other (e.g., `parent[rootV] = rootU`) AND increment the rank of the new root (`rank[rootU]++`).

#### C. `disjoint(vector< vector<int> > &edges, int n, int m)` (Initialization)

  * **Purpose**: To initialize the `parent` and `rank` arrays.
  * **Steps**:
      * For each element `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
          * Set `parent[i] = i` (each element is initially its own parent/root, forming `n` singleton sets).
          * Set `rank[i] = 0` (initial rank of each set/tree is 0).

### 4\. Time Complexity

  * With both **Path Compression** and **Union by Rank (or Size)** optimizations, the amortized time complexity for a sequence of `M` operations (`find` and `union`) on `N` elements is almost constant: `O(M * α(N))`, where `α` (alpha) is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows extremely slowly (for practical `N`, `α(N)` is less than 5).
  * Effectively, operations are considered **nearly constant time**.

### 5\. Space Complexity

  * `O(N)` for the `parent` and `rank` (or `size`) arrays.
