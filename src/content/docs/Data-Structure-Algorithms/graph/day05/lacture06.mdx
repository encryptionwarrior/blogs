### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Find all Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) in a given **directed graph**.
  * **SCC Definition**: A strongly connected component (SCC) of a directed graph is a maximal subgraph such that for every pair of vertices $(u, v)$ in the subgraph, there is a path from $u$ to $v$ and a path from $v$ to $u$. In other words, all vertices within an SCC are reachable from each other.
  * **Input**: List of `edges (u, v)` representing directed edges `u -> v`, total `n` nodes, total `m` edges.
  * **Output**: The total count of SCCs in the graph. (The code currently only returns the count).

### 2\. Core Idea (Kosaraju's Algorithm)

Kosaraju's algorithm is a two-pass Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find SCCs.

  * **Pass 1 (DFS on original graph for Topological Sort Order)**:

      * Perform a DFS traversal on the original graph.
      * As each node's DFS call **finishes** (i.e., all its reachable neighbors are visited), push the node onto a stack. This stack will effectively store nodes in decreasing order of their finishing times (or roughly, a topological sort order of the graph's condensation graph).

  * **Pass 2 (DFS on Transposed Graph based on Stack Order)**:

      * Create a **transpose (or reverse)** graph, where all edge directions are reversed (`u -> v` becomes `v -> u`).
      * Pop nodes one by one from the stack generated in Pass 1.
      * For each popped node, if it hasn't been visited yet, perform a DFS starting from this node in the **transpose graph**. All nodes visited during this DFS call form one SCC. Increment the SCC count.

**Why it works**:
The nodes at the top of the stack (from Pass 1) are those that finished last, meaning they are likely part of "source" SCCs in the condensation graph (graph of SCCs). When we traverse the transpose graph, following edges in reverse effectively allows us to reach all nodes that can reach the current popped node, thus revealing an entire SCC. The topological order ensures that we process "sink" SCCs in the reversed graph first, effectively peeling off one SCC at a time.

### 3\. Algorithm Steps (`stronglyConnectedComponents`, `topoSort`, `revDFS` functions)

#### A. `topoSort` Function (Pass 1 DFS)

  * **Purpose**: Performs a DFS on the original graph and pushes nodes onto a stack in their finishing order.
  * **Parameters**: `node`, `visited` array, `stack<int> st`, `adjList` (original graph).
  * **Logic**:
    1.  Mark `node` as `visited[node] = true`.
    2.  For each `neigh` in `adjList[node]`:
          * If `!visited[neigh]`, recursively call `topoSort(neigh, ...)`
    3.  **After all neighbors are visited and recursive calls return**: `st.push(node);` (This is the key step for ordering).

#### B. `revDFS` Function (Pass 2 DFS on Transpose Graph)

  * **Purpose**: Performs DFS on the transpose graph to identify nodes within a single SCC.
  * **Parameters**: `node`, `visited` array, `transpose` (transposed graph's adjList).
  * **Logic**:
    1.  Mark `node` as `visited[node] = true`.
    2.  For each `neigh` in `transpose[node]`:
          * If `!visited[neigh]`, recursively call `revDFS(neigh, ...)`

#### C. `stronglyConnectedComponents` Function (Main Wrapper)

1.  **Build Original Adjacency List**:

      * Create `adjList` (`unordered_map<int, list<int>>`) from the input directed `edges (u, v)`: `adjList[u].push_back(v);`.

2.  **Pass 1: Topological Sort (DFS for finishing times)**:

      * Initialize `stack<int> st` and `vector<bool> visited(n, false)`.
      * Loop `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
          * If `!visited[i]`, call `topoSort(i, visited, st, adjList);`. This ensures all components are covered.

3.  **Create Transpose Graph**:

      * Initialize `unordered_map<int, list<int>> transpose;`.
      * Reset `visited` array to `false` for all nodes: `for(int i=0; i<n; i++) visited[i] = false;`. (Crucial for Pass 2).
      * Iterate through the original `adjList`:
          * For each `u` and its `neigh` in `adjList[u]`:
              * Add edge `neigh -> u` to the transpose graph: `transpose[neigh].push_back(u);`.

4.  **Pass 2: DFS on Transpose Graph (using stack order)**:

      * Initialize `count = 0;` (to count SCCs).
      * While `st` is not empty:
          * Pop `top = st.top(); st.pop();`
          * If `!visited[top]`: (This means `top` belongs to a new, unvisited SCC)
              * Increment `count++;`
              * Call `revDFS(top, visited, transpose);` (This DFS will visit all nodes in the current SCC).

5.  **Return**: `count` (total number of SCCs).

### 4\. Time and Space Complexity

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * Building `adjList`: `O(M)`.
      * Pass 1 DFS (`topoSort`): Each vertex and edge is visited once. `O(V + E)`.
      * Creating Transpose Graph: Each edge is processed once. `O(V + E)`.
      * Pass 2 DFS (`revDFS`): Each vertex and edge in the transpose graph is visited once. `O(V + E)`.
      * Total: **`O(V + E)`**.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * `adjList` and `transpose` lists: `O(V + E)`.
      * `visited` array: `O(V)`.
      * `stack`: `O(V)` in worst case.
      * Recursion stack for DFS: `O(V)` in worst case (skewed graph).
      * Total: **`O(V + E)`**.

### 5\. Important Notes

  * **Directed Graphs Only**: SCCs are a concept specific to directed graphs.
  * **Connectivity**: Even if the original graph is not strongly connected, Kosaraju's algorithm correctly identifies all maximal strongly connected subgraphs.
  * **Alternative Algorithms**: Tarjan's algorithm and Gabow's algorithm are other popular methods for finding SCCs, which are typically single-pass DFS algorithms and might be more efficient in practice (avoiding explicit transpose graph creation) but are conceptually more complex.
