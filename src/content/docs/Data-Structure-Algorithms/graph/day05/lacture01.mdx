### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Find a **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a connected, undirected, weighted graph.
  * **MST Definition**: A spanning tree is a subgraph that connects all vertices together, without any cycles, and uses exactly `V-1` edges (where `V` is the number of vertices). A **Minimum** Spanning Tree is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible.
  * **Input**: List of weighted `edges (u, v, w)`, total `n` nodes, total `m` edges.
  * **Output**: A list of edges that form the MST, along with their weights.

### 2\. Core Idea (Prim's Algorithm - Greedy Approach)

Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that builds the MST one edge at a time, starting from an arbitrary initial node.

  * It grows a tree from a starting vertex by iteratively adding the cheapest edge that connects a vertex already in the tree to a vertex not yet in the tree.
  * It maintains three key pieces of information for each vertex `v`:
      * `key[v]`: The minimum weight of an edge connecting `v` to the current MST.
      * `mst[v]`: A boolean flag indicating whether `v` has already been included in the MST.
      * `parent[v]`: The parent of `v` in the MST (i.e., the node from which `v` was added to the MST).

### 3\. Algorithm Steps (`calculatePrimsMST` function)

1.  **Build Adjacency List**:

      * Create an `adjList` (`unordered_map<int, list<pair<int, int>>>`).
      * For each edge `(u, v, w)`:
          * Add `v` with weight `w` to `adjList[u]`.
          * Add `u` with weight `w` to `adjList[v]` (since it's an undirected graph).

2.  **Initialize Data Structures**:

      * `key`: A `vector<int>` of size `n`, initialized to `INT_MAX`. `key[i]` will store the minimum weight to connect node `i` to the current MST.
      * `mst`: A `vector<bool>` of size `n`, initialized to `false`. `mst[i] = true` means node `i` is included in the MST.
      * `parent`: A `vector<int>` of size `n`, initialized to `-1`. `parent[i]` will store the node from which `i` was added to the MST.

3.  **Start Node Initialization**:

      * Choose an arbitrary starting node (e.g., node 0).
      * Set `key[0] = 0`. (The cost to include the starting node itself is 0).

4.  **Main Loop (Iterate `n` times to include all `n` nodes)**:

      * Loop `i` from `0` to `n-1`: (This loop finds and adds one node to MST in each iteration)
          * **Find Minimum Key Node**:
              * Initialize `u` (node to be picked) and `mini = INT_MAX`.
              * Iterate through all nodes `j` from `0` to `n-1`:
                  * If `mst[j]` is `false` (node `j` not yet in MST) AND `key[j] < mini`:
                      * Update `mini = key[j]`.
                      * Set `u = j`.
              * At the end of this inner loop, `u` will be the unvisited node with the smallest `key` value.
          * **Include `u` in MST**: Set `mst[u] = true`.
          * **Update Neighbors' Keys**: For each `neighbor (x.first)` with `weight (x.second)` in `adjList[u]`:
              * If `mst[x.first]` is `false` (neighbor not yet in MST) AND `x.second < key[x.first]`:
                  * Update `key[x.first] = x.second`. (A cheaper edge to connect `x.first` to the MST is found).
                  * Update `parent[x.first] = u`. (Node `u` is now the best parent for `x.first`).

5.  **Construct MST Edges**:

      * Create an empty `vector<pair<pair<int, int>, int>> answer`. This will store edges as `{{u, v}, weight}`.
      * Loop `i` from `1` to `n-1` (skipping the initial node 0, as it has no parent edge):
          * Add `{{parent[i], i}, key[i]}` to `answer`. `parent[i]` is the node from which `i` was connected, and `key[i]` is the weight of that edge.

6.  **Return**: The `answer` vector, which represents the edges of the MST.

### 4\. Time and Space Complexity

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(V^2)`
      * Building `adjList`: `O(M)`.
      * Main loop runs `V` times.
      * Inside the main loop:
          * Finding minimum `key` node: `O(V)` linear scan.
          * Updating neighbors: `O(degree(u))`. In total, over all iterations, `sum(degree(u))` is `O(E)`.
      * Total: `O(V * V + E)` which simplifies to `O(V^2)` because `E` can be at most `V^2` in a dense graph.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * `adjList`: `O(V + E)`.
      * `key` vector: `O(V)`.
      * `mst` vector: `O(V)`.
      * `parent` vector: `O(V)`.
      * `answer` vector: `O(V)` (as MST has `V-1` edges).

### 5\. Optimizations (Using Priority Queue)

  * The `O(V)` linear scan to find the minimum `key` node in each iteration can be optimized.
  * By using a `min-priority queue` (e.g., `std::set<pair<int, int>>` or `std::priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>>`), finding the minimum becomes `O(log V)`.
  * This brings the time complexity down to `O(E log V)`. This is the standard competitive programming implementation for Prim's.
