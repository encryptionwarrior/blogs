int findParent(vector<int> &parent, int node) {
    // Base Case: If the node is its own parent, it's the root of its set.

        return node;
    }

    // Recursive Step (Going upwards in hierarchy):
    // Path Compression Logic:
    // During the recursive call, assign the returned root directly to `parent[node]`.
    // This flattens the tree by making all nodes in the path point directly to the root,
    // making future `find` operations for these nodes much faster.
    return parent[node] = findParent(parent, parent[node]);
}

// unionSet: Merges the sets containing 'u' and 'v' using Union by Rank optimization.
// 'u', 'v': The two nodes whose sets are to be merged.
// 'parent': The parent array.
// 'rank': The rank array (stores approximate height of trees).

    // If 'u' and 'v' are already in the same set (have the same root), do nothing.
    // This check is typically done *before* calling unionSet in Kruskal's.
    if(u == v) {
        return; // Already in the same component.
    }

    // Union by Rank: Attach the root of the smaller rank tree under the root of the larger rank tree.
    // This helps in keeping the overall tree height minimal, improving findParent performance.
    if(rank[u] < rank[v]) {
        parent[u] = v; // Make 'v' the parent of 'u'.
    } else if(rank[v] < rank[u]) {

### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Find a **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a connected, undirected, weighted graph.
  * **MST Definition**: A spanning tree that connects all vertices using `V-1` edges, without cycles, and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
  * **Input**: A list of weighted `edges (u, v, w)`, and the total number of `n` nodes. The number of edges `m` is implicitly handled by the `edges.size()`.
  * **Output**: The total minimum weight of the MST. (The code currently returns only the total weight, not the edges themselves).

### 2\. Core Idea (Kruskal's Algorithm - Greedy Approach)

Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that builds the MST by considering edges in increasing order of their weights. It uses the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to efficiently detect and prevent cycles.

  * **Sort Edges**: All edges are sorted in non-decreasing order of their weights.
  * **Iterate and Add**: Iterate through the sorted edges. For each edge `(u, v, w)`:
      * **Cycle Check**: Use DSU's `findParent` operation to check if `u` and `v` are already in the same connected component (i.e., if adding this edge would form a cycle).
      * **Add to MST**: If `u` and `v` are in different components, add this edge to the MST. Update the total MST weight. Then, use DSU's `unionSet` operation to merge the components of `u` and `v`.
      * **Skip**: If `u` and `v` are already in the same component, skip this edge as it would form a cycle.
  * **Termination**: The algorithm stops when `N-1` edges have been added to the MST (for a connected graph with `N` nodes), or when all edges have been processed.

### 3\. Key Components and Algorithm Steps

#### A. Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Functions (Reused from previous notes)

  * **`findParent(vector<int> &parent, int node)`**:
      * Finds the representative (root) of the set containing `node`.
      * **Path Compression Optimization**: Flattens the tree by making all nodes in the path point directly to the root, optimizing future `find` calls.
  * **`unionSet(int u, int v, vector<int> &parent, vector<int> &rank)`**:
      * Merges the sets containing `u` and `v`.
      * **Union by Rank Optimization**: Attaches the root of the shorter tree to the root of the taller tree to keep the overall tree height small.

#### B. Edge Comparison Function (`compare`)

  * **`bool compare(vector<int> &a, vector<int> &b)`**:
      * A custom comparison function used with `std::sort`.
      * It takes two edge representations (e.g., `vector<int>` where `a[2]` is weight) and returns `true` if `a` should come before `b` in sorted order based on their weights. (`a[2] < b[2]`).

#### C. `calculateKruskalsMST(vector<vector<int>> &edges, int n)` Function

1.  **Initialize DSU**:

      * Create `vector<int> parent(n)` and `vector<int> rank(n)`.
      * For each node `i` from `0` to `n-1`: `parent[i] = i` (each node starts in its own set), `rank[i] = 0`.

2.  **Sort Edges**:

      * `sort(edges.begin(), edges.end(), compare);` Sorts all input edges by their weights in non-decreasing order.

3.  **Initialize MST Weight**:

      * `int minWeight = 0;` (This variable will accumulate the total weight of edges added to the MST).

4.  **Iterate Through Sorted Edges**:

      * Loop through each edge `edges[i]` in the sorted `edges` vector:
          * Extract `u = edges[i][0]`, `v = edges[i][1]`, `w = edges[i][2]`.
          * **Cycle Check**: Find the representatives of `u` and `v`: `rootU = findParent(parent, u)` and `rootV = findParent(parent, v)`.
          * **If no cycle (different roots)**:
              * `unionSet(rootU, rootV, parent, rank);` (Merge the sets of `u` and `v`).
              * `minWeight += w;` (Add the edge's weight to the total MST weight).
          * **If cycle (same roots)**:
              * Do nothing, as adding this edge would create a cycle.

5.  **Return**: `minWeight` (the total weight of the MST).

### 4\. Time and Space Complexity

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(E log E + E α(V))`
      * Sorting edges: `O(E log E)` (where `E` is the number of edges).
      * DSU operations: `E` times `findParent` and `unionSet` operations. With path compression and union by rank, this is `O(E α(V))` (where `α` is the inverse Ackermann function, practically constant).
      * Total: Dominated by sorting, so **`O(E log E)`** or **`O(E log V)`** (since `E <= V^2`, `log E` is at most `2 log V`).
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(V + E)`
      * `parent` and `rank` arrays: `O(V)`.
      * Storing `edges`: `O(E)`.

### 5\. Important Notes

  * **Connectivity**: Kruskal's algorithm assumes the graph is connected. If the graph is not connected, it will find a Minimum Spanning Forest (a set of MSTs for each connected component). The returned `minWeight` would be the sum of weights of all such MSTs.
  * **Edge List Input**: Kruskal's algorithm is naturally suited for graphs represented by an edge list, as it requires sorting all edges.
  * **Outputting MST Edges**: The provided code only sums the total weight. To get the actual edges of the MST, you would store the `(u, v, w)` of the edges that satisfy `u != v` in a separate `vector` before returning.
