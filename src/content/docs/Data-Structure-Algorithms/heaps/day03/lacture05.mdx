Example Trace (with potential correction applied to Case -1 for explanation):

Input arr: [12, 10, 15, 20, 5]
N: 5

Initial: maxHeap={}, minHeap={}, median=0, ans=[]

1. Element = 12:
   signum(0,0) = 0.
   12 > median (0). Push 12 to minHeap.
   minHeap={12}, maxHeap={}
   median = minHeap.top() = 12.
   ans: [12]

2. Element = 10:
   signum(0,1) = -1. (minHeap is larger)
   10 < median (12). Push 10 to maxHeap.
   minHeap={12}, maxHeap={10}
   median = (10+12)/2 = 11.
   ans: [12, 11]

3. Element = 15:
   signum(1,1) = 0. (heaps balanced)
   15 > median (11). Push 15 to minHeap.
   minHeap={12, 15}, maxHeap={10}
   median = minHeap.top() = 12.
   ans: [12, 11, 12]

4. Element = 20:
   signum(1,2) = -1. (minHeap is larger)
   20 > median (12).
   // Original code would move minHeap.top() to maxHeap, then push 20 to minHeap.
   // This would make minHeap:{15,20}, maxHeap:{10,12}. Sizes 2,2. Median (12+15)/2 = 13.

   minHeap.pop();               // maxH:{10,12}, minH:{} -> minH:{15} (error here, minHeap becomes empty)

   ans: [12, 11, 12, 13]

5. Element = 5:

Final Median: 12

Note on the commented line in Case -1:
The provided code for `case -1` when `element <= median` appears to have a logical flaw that might not correctly balance the heaps or place the element. The standard approach for `case -1` (`minHeap.size() > maxHeap.size()`) when `element <= median` is simply to push the `element` into `maxHeap`, thereby balancing the sizes.
```

### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Given a continuous stream of numbers, efficiently find the median of the numbers processed so far, as each new number arrives.
  * **Median**:
      * If the total count of numbers is **odd**, the median is the middle element.
      * If the total count of numbers is **even**, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

### 2\. Challenge & Approach: Two Heaps

  * **Challenge**: A naive approach would be to store all numbers in a list and sort it for each new element, which is inefficient (`O(N log N)` per insertion).
  * **Solution: Two Heaps**
      * We divide the numbers seen so far into two halves:
          * **`maxHeap` (or `left_half`)**: A Max Heap storing the **smaller half** of the numbers. Its `top()` will be the largest element in the smaller half.
          * **`minHeap` (or `right_half`)**: A Min Heap storing the **larger half** of the numbers. Its `top()` will be the smallest element in the larger half.
      * **Invariants (Properties to maintain)**:
        1.  All elements in `maxHeap` are less than or equal to all elements in `minHeap`. (`maxHeap.top() <= minHeap.top()`).
        2.  The size difference between `maxHeap` and `minHeap` is at most 1.
              * `maxHeap.size() == minHeap.size()` (for even total elements)
              * `maxHeap.size() == minHeap.size() + 1` (for odd total elements, median is `maxHeap.top()`)
              * `minHeap.size() == maxHeap.size() + 1` (for odd total elements, median is `minHeap.top()`) - *The provided code uses this second setup for odd counts.*

### 3\. `signum(int a, int b)` Helper Function

  * **Purpose**: A utility function to compare the sizes of the two heaps.
  * **Returns**:
      * `0` if `a == b` (heaps are balanced in size).
      * `1` if `a > b` (`maxHeap` is larger).
      * `-1` if `a < b` (`minHeap` is larger).

### 4\. `callMedian(int element, ...)` Logic

This is the core function that handles inserting a new `element` and updating the `median`. It operates based on the `signum` of the heap sizes:

  * **Case 0: `maxHeap.size() == minHeap.size()` (Balanced)**

      * This implies an even number of elements *before* the current `element` is inserted. After insertion, the total number of elements will be odd.
      * If `element > median` (or generally, if `element` belongs to the larger half):
          * `minHeap.push(element)`. The `median` is now `minHeap.top()`.
      * Else (`element <= median`, or `element` belongs to the smaller half):
          * `maxHeap.push(element)`. The `median` is now `maxHeap.top()`.
      * After this, one heap will have one more element than the other, and the median will be the top of the larger heap.

  * **Case 1: `maxHeap.size() > minHeap.size()` (`maxHeap` is larger)**

      * This implies an odd number of elements *before* the current `element` is inserted, and the `median` was `maxHeap.top()`. After insertion, total elements will be even.
      * If `element > median`:
          * `minHeap.push(element)`. Now `maxHeap.size() == minHeap.size()`.
      * Else (`element <= median`):
          * To rebalance and maintain `maxHeap.top() <= minHeap.top()`:
          * Move `maxHeap.top()` to `minHeap`.
          * `maxHeap.pop()`.
          * `maxHeap.push(element)`.
      * The `median` is now `(minHeap.top() + maxHeap.top()) / 2`.

  * **Case -1: `minHeap.size() > maxHeap.size()` (`minHeap` is larger)**

      * This implies an odd number of elements *before* the current `element` is inserted, and the `median` was `minHeap.top()`. After insertion, total elements will be even.
      * If `element < median`:
          * `maxHeap.push(element)`. Now `maxHeap.size() == minHeap.size()`.
      * Else (`element >= median`):
          * To rebalance and maintain `maxHeap.top() <= minHeap.top()`:
          * Move `minHeap.top()` to `maxHeap`.
          * `minHeap.pop()`.
          * `minHeap.push(element)`.
      * The `median` is now `(minHeap.top() + maxHeap.top()) / 2`.

### 5\. `findMedian(vector<int>& arr, int N)` Function

  * Initializes `ans` vector, `maxHeap`, `minHeap`, and `median` (usually 0 or an appropriate default for the first element).
  * Iterates through each `element` in the input `arr`.
  * For each `element`, it calls `callMedian` to update the heaps and the `median`.
  * Adds the calculated `median` to the `ans` vector.
  * Returns the `ans` vector containing medians at each step.

### 6\. Complexity Analysis

  * Let `N` be the total number of elements in the stream.
  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N log N)`
      * Each time a new element arrives, we perform a constant number of heap operations (`push`, `pop`, `top`).
      * Heap operations on a heap of size `H` take `O(log H)` time. Here, `H` is at most `N/2`.
      * Therefore, each element processing takes `O(log N)` time.
      * Total time for `N` elements: `N * O(log N) = O(N log N)`.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(N)`
      * The two heaps together store all `N` elements from the stream.
