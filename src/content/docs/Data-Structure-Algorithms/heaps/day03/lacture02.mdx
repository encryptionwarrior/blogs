### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Given `K` sorted arrays, merge them into a single sorted array.
  * **Example**: `arr1 = {1, 5, 9}`, `arr2 = {2, 3, 8}`, `arr3 = {4, 6, 7}`
      * Merged sorted array: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}`

### 2\. Challenge & Approach: Efficiently Picking the Next Element

  * **Challenge**: How do we efficiently find the absolute smallest element among the `K` arrays at each step?
  * **Solution: Min Heap (Priority Queue)**
      * **Core Idea**: We use a Min Heap to keep track of the *smallest element currently available* from each of the `K` arrays.
      * **How it works**:
        1.  Initialize the Min Heap by adding the **first element** of each of the `K` arrays into it.
        2.  Repeatedly extract the minimum element from the heap. This element is the next one in our merged sorted array.
        3.  After extracting an element, if the array it came from still has more elements, add the *next* element from that same array into the heap. This ensures the heap always contains `K` (or fewer, if some arrays are exhausted) candidates for the next smallest element.

### 3\. Custom `Node` Class and `compare` Functor

  * **Why `Node`?**: When an element is extracted from the heap, we not only need its `data` (value) but also need to know *which array* it came from (`row`) and *its position* within that array (`col`). This information is crucial to fetch the next element from the correct array.
  * **`Node` Structure**: `data` (the element value), `row` (index of the array), `col` (index within that array).
  * **Why `compare`?**: The `priority_queue` by default uses `std::less` for basic types (making it a Max Heap). When storing custom objects or pointers (`Node*`), we need to provide a custom comparison logic.
      * For a **Min Heap**, the `operator()` in the `compare` class should return `true` if `a` should have *lower priority* than `b` (i.e., `a`'s data is greater than `b`'s data). This ensures smaller values float to the top.

### 4\. `mergeSortedArrays(vector<vector<int>> kArrays, int K)` Logic

1.  **Initialization (`Step 1`)**:
      * Create a `minHeap` of `Node*` using the `compare` functor.
      * For each of the `K` input arrays:
          * Create a `new Node` for its first element (`kArrays[row][0]`), storing its `row` and `0` for `col`.
          * `push` this `Node*` into the `minHeap`.
2.  **Extraction & Replenishment (`Step 2`)**:
      * Create an empty `ans` vector to store the final sorted result.
      * Loop `while(minHeap.size() > 0)`:
          * **Extract Minimum**: Get the `Node* temp` from `minHeap.top()`. This `temp->data` is the smallest element available globally.
          * Add `temp->data` to `ans`.
          * `minHeap.pop()`: Remove `temp` from the heap.
          * **Identify Source**: Get `row` and `col` from `temp`.
          * **Fetch Next**: If there's a next element in the *same array* (`col + 1 < kArrays[row].size()`):
              * Create a `new Node` for `kArrays[row][col+1]`, with the same `row` but `col+1`.
              * `push` this `new Node*` into the `minHeap`.
3.  **Return**: The `ans` vector.

### 5\. Complexity Analysis

  * Let `N` be the total number of elements across all `K` arrays. (`N = sum of lengths of all kArrays`).
  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N log K)`
      * **Initial Population**: `K` insertions into the heap. Each `push` takes `O(log K)`. Total `O(K log K)`.
      * **Main Loop**: The loop runs `N` times (because each of the `N` elements is extracted exactly once). In each iteration:
          * `minHeap.top()` is `O(1)`.
          * `ans.push_back()` is `O(1)` amortized.
          * `minHeap.pop()` is `O(log K)`.
          * `minHeap.push()` is `O(log K)`.
          * So, each iteration is `O(log K)`.
      * Total: `O(K log K + N log K) = O(N log K)` (since `N >= K`).
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(N + K)`
      * `O(N)` for the `ans` vector (to store the final merged array).
      * `O(K)` for the `minHeap` (it stores at most `K` elements/nodes simultaneously).
      * **Memory Management Note**: The code uses `new Node(...)`. For each element pushed into the heap, a new `Node` object is dynamically allocated. These objects are *not* explicitly `delete`d in the provided code. In C++, this would lead to a memory leak. In competitive programming, `new` is often used without `delete` if the program terminates quickly and memory limits are not strict. For robust code, consider using `std::unique_ptr` with custom deleter, `std::shared_ptr`, or manual `delete` when a node is no longer needed (e.g., after `minHeap.pop()` and before returning from the function, though careful management is needed to ensure nodes added to `ans` are not deleted prematurely).
