Example Usage:

Input K: 3
Input N: 4 (assuming uniform size)
Array 1: 1 8 10 15
Array 2: 5 12 18 22
Array 3: 9 14 20 24

Step-by-step Trace:

Initial state:
minHeap: {}
mini = INT_MAX, maxi = INT_MIN
start = 0, end = 0 (or some initial dummy value, then updated after first K elements)

Step 1: Populate heap with first elements
- Array 0, element 1: mini=1, maxi=1. Push Node(1,0,0).
- Array 1, element 5: mini=1, maxi=5. Push Node(5,1,0).
- Array 2, element 9: mini=1, maxi=9. Push Node(9,2,0).
minHeap: { (1,0,0), (5,1,0), (9,2,0) } (top is 1)
Current window: [1, 9]. Range length = 9 - 1 + 1 = 9.
start = 1, end = 9.

Step 2: Process ranges
Loop 1:
- temp = (1,0,0). Pop. mini=1.
- Current range (maxi - mini) = (9 - 1) = 8.
- (maxi - mini) < (end - start) => 8 < (9 - 1) => 8 < 8 (False, or True if strict <). Let's use <= for tie-breaking.
  The condition is `maxi - mini < end - start`. So 8 < 8 is false. No update.
- Check next element for Array 0: col=0+1=1 < N=4. Yes. Next element is kArrays[0][1] = 8.
- maxi = max(9, 8) = 9.
- Push Node(8,0,1).
minHeap: { (5,1,0), (8,0,1), (9,2,0) } (top is 5)

Loop 2:
- temp = (5,1,0). Pop. mini=5.
- Current range (maxi - mini) = (9 - 5) = 4.
- 4 < (9 - 1) => 4 < 8 (True). Update start=5, end=9.
- Check next element for Array 1: col=0+1=1 < N=4. Yes. Next element is kArrays[1][1] = 12.
- maxi = max(9, 12) = 12.
- Push Node(12,1,1).
minHeap: { (8,0,1), (9,2,0), (12,1,1) } (top is 8)

Loop 3:
- temp = (8,0,1). Pop. mini=8.
- Current range (maxi - mini) = (12 - 8) = 4.
- 4 < (9 - 5) => 4 < 4 (False). No update.
- Check next element for Array 0: col=1+1=2 < N=4. Yes. Next element is kArrays[0][2] = 10.
- maxi = max(12, 10) = 12.
- Push Node(10,0,2).
minHeap: { (9,2,0), (10,0,2), (12,1,1) } (top is 9)

Loop 4:
- temp = (9,2,0). Pop. mini=9.
- Current range (maxi - mini) = (12 - 9) = 3.
- 3 < (9 - 5) => 3 < 4 (True). Update start=9, end=12.
- Check next element for Array 2: col=0+1=1 < N=4. Yes. Next element is kArrays[2][1] = 14.
- maxi = max(12, 14) = 14.
- Push Node(14,2,1).
minHeap: { (10,0,2), (12,1,1), (14,2,1) } (top is 10)

... and so on. The process continues until one array is exhausted.

If the range [9,12] is confirmed as the smallest, the result would be (12-9)+1 = 4.

### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Given `K` sorted lists (or arrays), find the smallest range `[min_val, max_val]` such that this range contains at least one element from *each* of the `K` lists.
  * **Smallest Range**: A range `[a, b]` is smaller than `[c, d]` if `b - a < d - c`. If `b - a == d - c`, then `a < c`.
  * **Example**:
      * List 1: `[1, 8, 10, 15]`
      * List 2: `[5, 12, 18]`
      * List 3: `[9, 14, 20]`
      * One possible range: `[8, 9]` (contains 8 from L1, no element from L2, 9 from L3 - INVALID)
      * One possible range containing all: `[8, 12]` (contains 8 from L1, 12 from L2, no element from L3 - INVALID)
      * Correct range: `[9, 12]` (contains 10 from L1, 12 from L2, 9 from L3). Length = `12 - 9 + 1 = 4`.
      * Smallest range: `[9, 12]` is not the smallest. Consider starting elements: `[1,5,9]`. max is 9, min is 1. Range = 8.
      * After pulling 1 (from list 1), push 8 (from list 1). Elements in heap: `[5,8,9]`. max is 9, min is 5. Range = 4. Update best range.
      * After pulling 5 (from list 2), push 12 (from list 2). Elements in heap: `[8,9,12]`. max is 12, min is 8. Range = 4. Update best range if needed.

### 2\. Approach: Sliding Window with Min Heap

  * **Key Idea**: We need to maintain a "window" of `K` elements, one from each list. The `min` value of this window will be the smallest element currently available from *any* of the `K` lists, and the `max` value will be the largest among these `K` elements.

  * **Data Structure: Min Heap**: A Min Heap is ideal for efficiently getting the minimum element among the `K` candidates (one from each list).

  * **`Node` Structure**: Similar to "Merge K Sorted Arrays," each node in the heap needs to store:

      * `data`: The actual element value.
      * `row`: The index of the array/list it came from.
      * `col`: Its index within that array/list. This allows us to fetch the *next* element from the correct list.

  * **Custom Comparator**: Necessary for the `priority_queue` to order `Node*` objects based on their `data` values in ascending order (for a Min Heap).

  * **Algorithm Steps (Sliding Window Logic)**:

    1.  **Initialization**:
          * Create a `minHeap`.
          * Initialize `mini = INT_MAX`, `maxi = INT_MIN`. These will track the *current* minimum and maximum values *among the `K` elements currently in the heap*.
          * For each of the `K` lists, insert its **first element** into the `minHeap`. While inserting, update `mini` and `maxi` to reflect the range formed by these initial `K` elements.
          * Store this initial range as our best `start` and `end` values. (`start = mini`, `end = maxi`).
    2.  **Iterative Refinement (Sliding)**:
          * Loop as long as the `minHeap` is not empty:
              * **Extract Minimum**: Get the smallest element (`temp = minHeap.top()`) from the heap. This `temp->data` becomes the new `mini` of our current window.
              * `minHeap.pop()`: Remove this element.
              * **Update Best Range**: Compare the current range (`maxi - mini`) with the best range found so far (`end - start`). If the current range is smaller, update `start` and `end`.
              * **Slide Window**:
                  * Check if there's a *next* element in the list from which `temp` was just extracted (`temp->col + 1 < N`).
                  * If yes:
                      * Add this `next` element `kArrays[temp->row][temp->col + 1]` to the `minHeap`.
                      * **Crucially**: Update `maxi = max(maxi, kArrays[temp->row][temp->col + 1])`. This is because the newly added element *could be the new maximum* in the window of `K` elements.
                  * If no (one list is exhausted): Break the loop. We can no longer form a range that includes at least one element from all `K` lists.
    3.  **Result**: Return `(end - start) + 1` (the size of the smallest range).

### 3\. Complexity Analysis

  * Let `K` be the number of arrays, and `N` be the (assumed uniform) size of each array. Total elements `M = K * N`.
  * **Time Complexity**: `O(M log K)`
      * **Initial Population**: `K` insertions into the heap. Each `push` takes `O(log K)`. Total `O(K log K)`.
      * **Main Loop**: The loop runs `N*K - K + 1` times in the worst case (each element is processed once). In each iteration:
          * `minHeap.top()` is `O(1)`.
          * `minHeap.pop()` is `O(log K)`.
          * `max` operation is `O(1)`.
          * `minHeap.push()` is `O(log K)`.
          * So, each iteration is `O(log K)`.
      * Total: `O(K log K + (N*K - K) log K) = O(N*K log K) = O(M log K)`.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(K)`
      * The `minHeap` stores at most `K` `Node*` objects (one from each array at any given time).
      * **Memory Management Note**: The code uses `new Node(...)`. For robust code, these dynamically allocated `Node` objects should be `delete`d when they are no longer needed (e.g., after being popped from the heap and their next element, if any, is pushed). The current code does not explicitly manage this memory, which can lead to leaks in long-running applications.
