using namespace std;     // Use the standard namespace

// Definition for a singly-linked list node.
class List {
public:
    int data;  // Value stored in the node.
    List* next; // Pointer to the next node in the list.

    // Constructor to initialize a new node.
    List(int data) {
        this->data = data;
        this->next = NULL; // New node initially points to NULL.
    }
};

// Helper function to insert a new node at the end of a linked list.
// Used for building the input lists in main.
// 'head': Reference to the head pointer of the list.
// 'tail': Reference to the tail pointer of the list.
// 'val': The data value for the new node.
void insert(List* &head, List* &tail, int val) {
    List* temp = new List(val); // Create a new node.
    if(head == NULL) { // If the list is empty, new node is both head and tail.
        head = tail = temp;
    } else { // If list is not empty, append to tail.
        tail->next = temp; // Link current tail to new node.
        tail = temp;       // Update tail to the new node.
    }
}

// Custom comparator class for the priority_queue.
// Defines the ordering logic for 'List*' pointers.
// For a MIN HEAP (priority_queue by default is max-heap), we want 'a' to have higher priority
// (i.e., come before 'b') if a->data < b->data.
// So, 'operator()' returns true if 'a' has *lower priority* than 'b' (meaning a's data is GREATER than b's data).
class compare {
public:
    bool operator () (List* a, List* b) {
        return a->data > b->data; // If true, 'a' is placed after 'b' in the conceptual ordering.
                                 // Thus, smaller 'data' values will have higher priority (be at the top).

Example Usage:

Input K: 3
List 1: 1 5 9 -1
List 2: 2 3 8 -1
List 3: 4 6 7 -1

Step-by-step Trace (Conceptual):

Initial Min Heap:
- Head of List 1: Node(1)
- Head of List 2: Node(2)
- Head of List 3: Node(4)
Heap (conceptually): { Node(1), Node(2), Node(4) } (Node with 1 at top)
Merged List: NULL

Loop 1:
- top = Node(1). Pop Node(1).
- Node(1)->next is Node(5). Push Node(5) to heap.
- Merged List: 1 -> NULL (head=tail=Node(1))
Heap: { Node(2), Node(4), Node(5) } (Node with 2 at top)

Loop 2:
- top = Node(2). Pop Node(2).
- Node(2)->next is Node(3). Push Node(3) to heap.
- Merged List: 1 -> 2 -> NULL (tail=Node(2))
Heap: { Node(3), Node(4), Node(5) } (Node with 3 at top)

Loop 3:
- top = Node(3). Pop Node(3).
- Node(3)->next is Node(8). Push Node(8) to heap.
- Merged List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> NULL (tail=Node(3))
Heap: { Node(4), Node(5), Node(8) } (Node with 4 at top)

Loop 4:
- top = Node(4). Pop Node(4).
- Node(4)->next is Node(6). Push Node(6) to heap.
- Merged List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL (tail=Node(4))
Heap: { Node(5), Node(6), Node(8) } (Node with 5 at top)

Loop 5:
- top = Node(5). Pop Node(5).
- Node(5)->next is Node(9). Push Node(9) to heap.
- Merged List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL (tail=Node(5))
Heap: { Node(6), Node(8), Node(9) } (Node with 6 at top)

Loop 6:
- top = Node(6). Pop Node(6).
- Node(6)->next is Node(7). Push Node(7) to heap.
- Merged List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL (tail=Node(6))
Heap: { Node(7), Node(8), Node(9) } (Node with 7 at top)

Loop 7:
- top = Node(7). Pop Node(7).
- Node(7)->next is NULL. Don't push.
- Merged List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> NULL (tail=Node(7))
Heap: { Node(8), Node(9) } (Node with 8 at top)

Loop 8:
- top = Node(8). Pop Node(8).
- Node(8)->next is NULL. Don't push.
- Merged List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> NULL (tail=Node(8))
Heap: { Node(9) } (Node with 9 at top)

Loop 9:
- top = Node(9). Pop Node(9).
- Node(9)->next is NULL. Don't push.
- Merged List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> NULL (tail=Node(9))
Heap: {} (empty)

Loop terminates.
Output: Merged List : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Given `K` individual sorted Linked Lists, combine all their nodes to form a single, comprehensively sorted Linked List.
  * **Example**:
      * List 1: `1 -> 5 -> 9 -> NULL`
      * List 2: `2 -> 3 -> 8 -> NULL`
      * List 3: `4 -> 6 -> 7 -> NULL`
      * Merged Sorted List: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> NULL`

### 2\. Challenge & Approach: Efficiently Picking the Next Element

  * **Challenge**: At any point, we need to pick the smallest element from the `K` lists. A simple linear scan through the `K` current head nodes would be `O(K)` at each step, leading to `O(N*K)` total time (where `N` is total nodes).
  * **Solution: Min Heap (Priority Queue)**
      * **Core Idea**: Use a Min Heap to efficiently keep track of the *smallest available node* among the current heads of all `K` lists.
      * **How it works**:
        1.  **Initialize Heap**: Add the head node of each of the `K` sorted linked lists into the Min Heap.
        2.  **Iterative Merge**:
              * Repeatedly extract the node with the smallest value from the heap. This node is the next element in our merged sorted list.
              * Append this extracted node to our result list.
              * If the extracted node's original list has a next element (i.e., `extracted_node->next != NULL`), add that `next` node into the heap. This ensures that the heap always contains the "next candidates" from the lists that are still active.

### 3\. `List` Class and `compare` Functor

  * **`List` Class**: Represents a node in the linked list, containing `data` and a `next` pointer.
  * **`compare` Functor**:
      * `std::priority_queue` is a max-heap by default. To make it a min-heap (which we need to get the smallest element), we provide a custom comparator.
      * The `operator()` for `compare` returns `true` if `List* a` has *lower priority* than `List* b` (meaning `a`'s data is *greater* than `b`'s data). This causes elements with smaller `data` values to bubble up to the `top()`.

### 4\. `mergeSortedLists(vector<List* > kLists)` Logic

1.  **Handle Empty Input**: If `K` is 0 (no lists), return `NULL`.
2.  **Step 1: Populate Min Heap**:
      * Create a `minHeap` that stores `List*` pointers, ordered by our `compare` functor.
      * Iterate through the `kLists` vector. For each list, if its head is not `NULL` (i.e., the list is not empty), `push` its head node into the `minHeap`.
3.  **Step 2: Build Merged List**:
      * Initialize `head = NULL` and `tail = NULL`. These pointers will build our new merged list.
      * Loop `while(minHeap.size() > 0)`: (Continue as long as there are elements in the heap)
          * **Extract Smallest**: Get the `List* top` from `minHeap.top()`. This is the smallest node globally among all lists' current heads.
          * `minHeap.pop()`: Remove this `top` node from the heap.
          * **Replenish Heap**: If `top->next` is not `NULL` (meaning the list `top` came from has more elements):
              * `minHeap.push(top->next)`: Add the next node from that same list into the heap.
          * **Append to Result List**:
              * **First Node**: If `head` is `NULL` (this is the very first node of the merged list), set `head = tail = top`.
              * **Subsequent Nodes**: Otherwise, append `top` to the end of the current merged list: `tail->next = top; tail = top;`.
              * **Crucial**: Set `tail->next = NULL;` after linking to prevent cycles or accidental links from the original lists' structure. (The provided code *does not* explicitly set `tail->next = NULL;` inside the loop, which is important for the last node of the merged list to terminate correctly. It relies on the final `tail` having `next=NULL` from its original list's end or being correctly null for the last element, but it's safer to explicitly set it). I will add this for robustness in comments.
4.  **Return**: The `head` of the newly formed merged sorted linked list.

### 6\. Complexity Analysis

  * Let `N` be the total number of nodes across all `K` linked lists.
  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N log K)`
      * **Initial Population**: `K` insertions into the heap (one for each list head). Each `push` takes `O(log K)`. Total `O(K log K)`.
      * **Main Loop**: The loop runs `N` times (because each of the `N` nodes is extracted exactly once). In each iteration:
          * `minHeap.top()` is `O(1)`.
          * `minHeap.pop()` is `O(log K)`.
          * `minHeap.push()` is `O(log K)` (for the next node from the source list).
      * Total: `O(K log K + N log K) = O(N log K)` (since `N >= K`).
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(K)`
      * The `minHeap` stores at most `K` `List*` pointers (one node from each list at any given time).
      * Note: The algorithm reuses the existing nodes of the input linked lists by simply re-linking their `next` pointers. It does not create new `List` nodes for the merged list itself, keeping auxiliary space proportional only to `K`.
