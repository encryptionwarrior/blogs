Example Input Array: {90, 30, 20, 120, 50, 60, 40, 150} (n = 8)

Initial Array:
[90, 30, 20, 120, 50, 60, 40, 150]

Non-leaf nodes indices for n=8:
(8/2) - 1 = 3. So, we iterate i from 3 down to 0.

i = 3 (node 120):
    Children: 2*3+1 = 7 (150)
    120 is smaller than 150. Heapify(3) does nothing.
    Array: [90, 30, 20, 120, 50, 60, 40, 150]

i = 2 (node 20):
    Children: 2*2+1 = 5 (60), 2*2+2 = 6 (40)
    Smallest among (20, 60, 40) is 20. Heapify(2) does nothing.
    Array: [90, 30, 20, 120, 50, 60, 40, 150]

i = 1 (node 30):
    Children: 2*1+1 = 3 (120), 2*1+2 = 4 (50)
    Smallest among (30, 120, 50) is 30. Heapify(1) does nothing.
    Array: [90, 30, 20, 120, 50, 60, 40, 150]

i = 0 (node 90):
    Children: 2*0+1 = 1 (30), 2*0+2 = 2 (20)
    Smallest among (90, 30, 20) is 20.
    Swap 90 and 20. Array: [20, 30, 90, 120, 50, 60, 40, 150]
    Recursively call heapify(arr, 8, 2) (on new position of 90)
        Node at 2 is 90. Children: 2*2+1 = 5 (60), 2*2+2 = 6 (40)
        Smallest among (90, 60, 40) is 40.
        Swap 90 and 40. Array: [20, 30, 40, 120, 50, 60, 90, 150]
        Recursively call heapify(arr, 8, 6) (on new position of 90)
            Node at 6 is 90. Children: 2*6+1 = 13 (out of bounds), 2*6+2 = 14 (out of bounds)
            Heapify(6) does nothing. Returns.

Final Min Heap Array (approximate, exact order depends on tie-breaking rules and build process):
[20, 30, 40, 120, 50, 60, 90, 150]
This is a valid Min Heap.

### 1\. Heap Data Structure & Properties

  * A **Heap** is a complete binary tree (all levels filled except possibly the last, which is filled left-to-right).
  * **Min Heap Property**: For any given node `i`, the value of `i` is less than or equal to the values of its children. (Parent \<= Children). The smallest element is always at the root.

### 2\. Array Representation (0-based Indexing)

  * When a heap is stored in an array using **0-based indexing**:
      * If a node is at index `i`:
          * Its **left child** is at `2 * i + 1`.
          * Its **right child** is at `2 * i + 2`.
          * Its **parent** is at `(i - 1) / 2`.

### 3\. `heapify(vector<int>& arr, int n, int i)` Function

  * **Purpose**: This function is crucial for maintaining the Min Heap property. It takes a subtree rooted at index `i` (in an array `arr` of size `n`) and ensures it satisfies the Min Heap property, assuming its children's subtrees are already Min Heaps.
  * **Process ("Heapify Down")**:
    1.  Initialize `smallest = i` (assume current node is the smallest).
    2.  Calculate indices for `left` child (`2*i + 1`) and `right` child (`2*i + 2`).
    3.  **Compare with Left Child**: If the left child exists (`left < n`) and its value `arr[left]` is smaller than `arr[smallest]`, update `smallest = left`.
    4.  **Compare with Right Child**: If the right child exists (`right < n`) and its value `arr[right]` is smaller than `arr[smallest]` (which might now be the left child), update `smallest = right`.
    5.  **Swap and Recurse**:
          * If `smallest` is no longer `i` (meaning a child was smaller), swap `arr[i]` with `arr[smallest]`.
          * Recursively call `heapify(arr, n, smallest)` on the subtree where the swap occurred to ensure the heap property is maintained further down.
  * **Time Complexity**: `O(log N)`, as an element potentially moves from the root down to a leaf.

### 4\. `buildMinHeap(vector<int>& arr)` Function

  * **Purpose**: Converts an arbitrary input array (vector) into a Min Heap.
  * **Logic**:
    1.  Get the size `n` of the array.
    2.  Iterate backwards from the **last non-leaf node** up to the root.
          * For 0-based indexing, non-leaf nodes are from index `(n/2) - 1` down to `0`. (Nodes from `n/2` to `n-1` are leaves, which are inherently valid heaps of size 1).
    3.  For each non-leaf node `i` in this range, call `heapify(arr, n, i)`.
  * **Why this order?**: When `heapify(i)` is called, its children (`2*i+1`, `2*i+2`) are guaranteed to be either leaves or roots of subtrees that have already been heapified. This ensures the correct bottom-up construction.
  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`. Although individual `heapify` calls are `O(log N)`, the specific way `buildMinHeap` calls `heapify` on `N/2` nodes results in an optimized `O(N)` overall time complexity for heap construction.

### 5\. Main Function Usage

  * An example `vector<int>` is initialized.
  * `buildMinHeap` is called to convert it into a Min Heap.
  * The array is printed before and after heapification to demonstrate the change.
