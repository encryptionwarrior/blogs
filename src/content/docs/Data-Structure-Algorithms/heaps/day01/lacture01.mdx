### 1\. Heap Data Structure Basics

  * A **Heap** is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property.
      * **Complete Binary Tree**: All levels are completely filled, except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
  * **Heap Property**:
      * **Max Heap**: For any given node `i`, the value of `i` is greater than or equal to the values of its children. (Parent \>= Children)
      * **Min Heap**: For any given node `i`, the value of `i` is less than or equal to the values of its children. (Parent \<= Children)
  * **Array Representation**: Heaps are commonly implemented using an array, leveraging the complete binary tree property.
      * If a node is at index `i`:
          * Its left child is at `2*i`.
          * Its right child is at `2*i + 1`.
          * Its parent is at `i/2`.
      * Conventionally, `arr[0]` is often left unused to simplify these index calculations (1-based indexing).

### 2\. `Heap` Class Implementation (Max Heap)

  * **`arr[100]`**: A fixed-size array to store heap elements. `arr[0]` is intentionally unused.
  * **`size`**: Tracks the current number of elements in the heap. It represents the last valid index.

#### a. `Heap()` Constructor

  * Initializes `arr[0] = -1` (placeholder) and `size = 0` (empty heap).

#### b. `insert(int val)` Operation

  * **Purpose**: Adds a new element (`val`) to the Max Heap while maintaining the heap property.
  * **Process ("Heapify Up" / "Percolate Up")**:
    1.  Increment `size` and place `val` at the new `index = size` (`arr[index] = val`). This ensures completeness.
    2.  Start from `index` and move upwards towards the root (`while(index > 1)`).
    3.  Compare `arr[index]` with its `parent = index/2`.
    4.  If `arr[parent] < arr[index]` (Max Heap property violated), swap them.
    5.  Update `index = parent` and repeat.
    6.  Stop when `index` is 1 (root) or `arr[parent] >= arr[index]` (heap property satisfied).
  * **Time Complexity**: `O(log N)`, where N is the number of elements, as in the worst case, an element might travel from a leaf to the root.

#### c. `deleteHeap()` Operation (Removes Max Element - Root)

  * **Purpose**: Removes the maximum element (which is always at the root, `arr[1]`) from the Max Heap.
  * **Process ("Heapify Down" / "Percolate Down")**:
    1.  **Handle Empty Heap**: If `size == 0`, print error and return.
    2.  **Replace Root**: Copy the last element (`arr[size]`) to the root position (`arr[1]`).
    3.  **Decrement Size**: Decrease `size` by 1.
    4.  **Heapify Down**: Start from `i = 1` (the new root).
          * Loop `while(i < size)`:
              * Calculate `leftChild = 2*i` and `rightChild = 2*i + 1`.
              * Find the `largest` among `arr[i]`, `arr[leftChild]` (if it exists and is larger), and `arr[rightChild]` (if it exists and is larger).
              * If `largest` is still `i`, it means the current node is already greater than or equal to its children; heap property is satisfied. Break.
              * Otherwise, `swap(arr[i], arr[largest])` and update `i = largest` to continue heapifying down from the new position.
  * **Time Complexity**: `O(log N)`, as the new root might travel from the root to a leaf.

#### d. `print()`

  * Simple utility to print elements from `arr[1]` to `arr[size]`.

### 3\. `heapify(int arr[], int n, int i)` Function (External Function for Build Heap)

  * **Purpose**: This is a core recursive function used to **restore the heap property for a subtree** rooted at index `i` within an array `arr` of size `n`. It assumes its children's subtrees are already valid heaps.
  * **Process**:
    1.  Assume `largest` element is at `i`.
    2.  Calculate `left = 2*i` and `right = 2*i + 1`.
    3.  Compare `arr[largest]` with its `left` child: If `left` is a valid index (`<=n`) and `arr[left]` is greater, update `largest = left`.
    4.  Compare `arr[largest]` (which might have been updated to `left`) with its `right` child: If `right` is a valid index (`<=n`) and `arr[right]` is greater, update `largest = right`.
    5.  If `largest` is no longer `i` (meaning a child was larger), swap `arr[i]` with `arr[largest]`.
    6.  Recursively call `heapify` on the subtree where the swap occurred (`heapify(arr, n, largest)`) to ensure that subtree also maintains the heap property.
  * **Time Complexity**: `O(log N)`, as it involves percolating down one element.

### 4\. Building a Heap from an Array

  * **Logic (`main` function example)**: To convert an arbitrary array into a heap (Max Heap in this case), `heapify` is called on all **non-leaf nodes** in **reverse order** (from `n/2` down to `1`).
  * **Why `n/2` to `1`?**: Leaves (`n/2 + 1` to `n`) are already trivial heaps of size 1. By starting from the last non-leaf node and moving up, we ensure that when `heapify(i)` is called, its children (`2*i`, `2*i+1`) are either leaves or roots of already heapified subtrees.
  * **Time Complexity for Building Heap**: `O(N)`. Although `heapify` is `O(log N)`, when applied to `N/2` nodes in this specific order, the total complexity works out to be `O(N)`.
