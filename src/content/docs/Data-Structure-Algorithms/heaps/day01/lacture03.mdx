### 1\. Heap Sort Algorithm Overview

  * **Heap Sort** is a comparison-based sorting algorithm.
  * It leverages the **Heap data structure** (specifically a Max Heap for ascending order sort) to efficiently sort elements.
  * It is an **in-place** sorting algorithm (requires minimal additional memory, `O(1)` auxiliary space beyond input).
  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N log N)` in all cases (best, average, worst). This is because building the heap takes `O(N)` and then `N-1` extractions (each `O(log N)`) are performed.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` auxiliary space.

### 2\. Max Heap (1-based Indexing) Recap

  * **Max Heap Property**: For any node `i`, `value(i) >= value(children(i))`. The largest element is always at the root.
  * **Array Representation (1-based indexing)**:
      * Node at index `i`:
          * Left child: `2 * i`
          * Right child: `2 * i + 1`
          * Parent: `i / 2`
      * `arr[0]` is typically unused.

### 3\. `heapify(int arr[], int n, int i)` Function

  * **Purpose**: This is a crucial helper function. It takes a subtree rooted at index `i` (in an array `arr` of size `n`) and ensures it satisfies the **Max Heap property**, assuming its children's subtrees are already valid Max Heaps.
  * **Process ("Percolate Down")**:
    1.  Assume `largest = i` (current node is largest).
    2.  Calculate indices for `left` child (`2*i`) and `right` child (`2*i + 1`).
    3.  Compare `arr[largest]` with its `left` child: If `left` is a valid index (`<=n`) and `arr[left]` is greater, update `largest = left`.
    4.  Compare `arr[largest]` (which might now be the left child) with its `right` child: If `right` is a valid index (`<=n`) and `arr[right]` is greater, update `largest = right`.
    5.  If `largest` is no longer `i` (meaning a child was larger), `swap(arr[i], arr[largest])`.
    6.  Recursively call `heapify(arr, n, largest)` on the subtree where the swap occurred to ensure the heap property is maintained further down.
  * **Time Complexity**: `O(log N)`, as an element potentially moves from the root down to a leaf.

### 4\. `heapSort(int arr[], int size)` Function

  * **Purpose**: Sorts the array `arr` in ascending order.
  * **Two Main Phases**:
    1.  **Build Max Heap (Done in `main` function first)**: Convert the input array into a Max Heap. This is done by calling `heapify` on all non-leaf nodes in reverse order (from `size/2` down to `1`). This phase takes `O(N)` time.
    2.  **Extract Max & Heapify**:
          * The largest element is always at `arr[1]` (the root of the Max Heap).
          * **Swap**: Swap `arr[1]` with `arr[size]`. This places the largest element at its correct sorted position (the end of the array).
          * **Reduce Heap Size**: Decrement `size`. The element `arr[size+1]` is now considered sorted and out of the heap's consideration.
          * **Heapify Root**: Call `heapify(arr, size, 1)`. The new element at `arr[1]` (which was the original `arr[size]`) needs to be percolated down to restore the Max Heap property in the reduced heap.
          * Repeat this process `size-1` times (`while(size > 1)`).
  * **Time Complexity**: `N-1` extractions, each taking `O(log N)` for `heapify`. Total `O(N log N)`.

### 5\. Overall Heap Sort Steps

1.  Given an unsorted array `A` of size `N`.
2.  **Build a Max Heap** from `A`. This makes the largest element `A[1]`.
3.  Repeat `N-1` times:
      * Swap `A[1]` with `A[current_heap_size]`.
      * Decrement `current_heap_size`.
      * Call `heapify(A, current_heap_size, 1)` to fix the heap property at the root.
4.  After the loop, the array `A` will be sorted in ascending order.
