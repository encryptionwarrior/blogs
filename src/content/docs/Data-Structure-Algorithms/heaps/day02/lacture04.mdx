### 1\. Problem Statement: Merging Two Heaps

  * Given two collections of elements, often presented as arrays that might or might not already be heaps, the goal is to combine them into a single data structure that adheres to the heap property (either Max Heap or Min Heap).
  * The provided code implements merging two arrays into a single **Max Heap**.

### 2\. Approach: Simple Concatenation and Build Heap

  * **Core Idea**: The most straightforward and efficient way to merge two heaps (or arrays that you want to form a heap from) is to:
    1.  Combine all elements from both input structures into a single array.
    2.  Then, apply the **"Build Heap"** algorithm on this newly formed combined array.
  * **Build Heap Algorithm**:
      * To convert an arbitrary array into a heap (Max or Min), we iterate through all **non-leaf nodes** in **reverse order** (from the last non-leaf node up to the root) and apply the `heapify` operation on each.
      * This bottom-up approach ensures that when `heapify` is called on a node, its children's subtrees have already been heapified.
      * For 0-based indexing, the last non-leaf node is at index `(total_size / 2) - 1`.

### 3\. `heapify(vector<int> &arr, int index, int size)` Function

  * **Purpose**: This helper function restores the **Max Heap property** for a subtree rooted at `index` within the `arr` (of `size`). It assumes its children's subtrees are already valid Max Heaps.
  * **Indexing**: Uses **0-based indexing** for child calculations:
      * Left child: `2 * index + 1`
      * Right child: `2 * index + 2`
  * **Logic ("Percolate Down")**:
    1.  Initialize `largest = index`.
    2.  Compare `arr[largest]` with `arr[left]` (if `left` is valid and `arr[left]` is larger). Update `largest`.
    3.  Compare `arr[largest]` (potentially updated) with `arr[right]` (if `right` is valid and `arr[right]` is larger). Update `largest`.
    4.  If `largest` is no longer `index` (meaning a child was larger), swap `arr[index]` with `arr[largest]` and recursively call `heapify` on the subtree where the swap occurred (`heapify(arr, largest, size)`).
  * **Time Complexity**: `O(log K)` where K is the size of the subtree being heapified.

### 4\. `mergeHeaps(vector<int> arr1, vector<int> arr2)` Function

  * **Purpose**: Merges two input `vectors` (potentially representing heaps) into a single Max Heap `vector`.
  * **Steps**:
    1.  **Concatenation**: Iterates through `arr2` and `push_back`s each element into `arr1`. After this loop, `arr1` contains all elements from both original arrays.
    2.  **Build Heap**:
          * The `for` loop `for(int i = arr1.size()/2 - 1; i >= 0; i--)` iterates from the last non-leaf node's index down to the root (index 0).
          * For each such `i`, `heapify(arr1, i, arr1.size())` is called to correctly position the element at `arr1[i]` and its subtree to satisfy the Max Heap property.
  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N + M)`
      * Appending `arr2` to `arr1`: `O(M)` (where `M` is `arr2.size()`).
      * Building heap on `N+M` elements: `O(N + M)` (where `N` is `arr1.size()` initially).
      * Total: `O(N + M)`.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(N + M)`
      * The input `arr1` and `arr2` are passed by value, creating copies.
      * The combined `arr1` grows to `N+M` elements.
