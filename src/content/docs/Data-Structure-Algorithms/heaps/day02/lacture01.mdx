```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> // Includes common standard libraries, including <vector> and <queue>
using namespace std;     // Use the standard namespace

// Function to find the Kth smallest element in an array using a Max Heap.
// Time Complexity: O(N log K)
// Space Complexity: O(K)
int KthSmallest(vector<int> arr, int K) {
    // Step 1: Create a Max Heap (std::priority_queue is a Max Heap by default).
    // This heap will store the K smallest elements encountered so far.
    priority_queue<int> Heap;

    // Step 2: Insert the first K elements into the Max Heap.
    // At this point, Heap.top() will be the largest among these K elements.
    for(int i = 0; i < K; i++) {
        Heap.push(arr[i]);
    }

    // Step 3: Iterate through the remaining elements (from K to end of array).
    for(int i = K; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        // If the current array element (arr[i]) is smaller than the largest
        // element currently in our K-sized heap (Heap.top()).
        if(arr[i] < Heap.top()) {
            Heap.pop();      // Remove the current largest from the heap.
            Heap.push(arr[i]); // Add the smaller element to the heap.
            // This ensures the heap always contains the K smallest elements encountered so far.

    }

    // Step 4: After iterating through all elements, the top of the heap
    // will be the Kth smallest element overall.

/*
Example Usage:

Input Array: 7 10 4 3 20 15 -1
K: 3

Initial Heap (Max Heap of size K=3):
Elements: 7, 10, 4
Heap: {10, 7, 4} (top is 10)

Process remaining elements:
- Element 3: 3 < Heap.top() (10)
  Pop 10. Push 3. Heap: {7, 4, 3} (top is 7)
- Element 20: 20 > Heap.top() (7)
  Ignore. Heap remains: {7, 4, 3}
- Element 15: 15 > Heap.top() (7)
  Ignore. Heap remains: {7, 4, 3}

Final Heap.top(): 7
Output: Kth smallest element : 7

### 1\. Problem Statement: Kth Smallest Element

  * Given an unsorted array of numbers and an integer `K`, find the element that would be the Kth smallest if the array were sorted.
  * Example: `arr = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}`, `K = 3`.
      * Sorted: `{3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20}`.
      * 3rd smallest is `7`.

### 2\. Approach: Using a Max Heap of Size K

  * **Core Idea**: We want to find the Kth smallest element. If we maintain a collection of the `K` smallest elements encountered so far, the largest among them will be our candidate for the Kth smallest.
  * **Why Max Heap?**: A Max Heap is perfect for this because its `top()` element is always the largest.
      * We maintain a Max Heap of size `K`.
      * This heap will at all times contain the `K` smallest elements encountered so far from the input array.
  * **Algorithm Steps**:
    1.  **Initialize Heap**: Insert the first `K` elements from the input array into a `Max Heap`. At this point, the `top()` of the heap is the largest among these initial `K` elements.
    2.  **Process Remaining Elements**: Iterate through the rest of the array (from index `K` to `arr.size() - 1`).
          * For each `current_element = arr[i]`:
              * **Compare**: If `current_element` is **smaller** than `Heap.top()` (which is the largest of the current `K` smallest candidates):
                  * `Heap.pop()`: Remove the current largest element from the heap (since we found a smaller one that should be among the `K` smallest).
                  * `Heap.push(current_element)`: Insert `current_element` into the heap.
              * If `current_element` is greater than or equal to `Heap.top()`, it means it's not among the `K` smallest elements found so far, so we just ignore it.
    3.  **Result**: After processing all elements, the `Heap.top()` will be the Kth smallest element in the entire array.

### 3\. Complexity Analysis

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N log K)`
      * Initial `K` insertions: `K` operations, each `O(log K)`. Total `O(K log K)`.
      * Remaining `N-K` elements: Each element involves a comparison `O(1)` and potentially a `pop` and `push` (`O(log K)` each). Total `O((N-K) log K)`.
      * Combined: `O(K log K + (N-K) log K) = O(N log K)`.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(K)`
      * The Max Heap stores at most `K` elements.

### 4\. Alternative for Kth Largest Element

  * If the problem asked for the **Kth largest element**, you would use a **Min Heap** of size `K`.
  * Logic would be: If `arr[i]` is **greater** than `minHeap.top()`, then `minHeap.pop()` and `minHeap.push(arr[i])`.
