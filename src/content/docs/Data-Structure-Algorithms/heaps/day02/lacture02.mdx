// Function to find the Kth largest element in an array using a Min Heap.
// Time Complexity: O(N log K)
// Space Complexity: O(K)
int KthLargest(vector<int> arr, int K) {
    // Step 1: Create a Min Heap.
    // std::priority_queue<Type, Container, Comparator>
    // Here, greater<int> makes it a min-heap, meaning the smallest element is at the top.
    // This heap will store the K largest elements encountered so far.
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int> > Heap;

    // Step 2: Insert the first K elements into the Min Heap.
    // At this point, Heap.top() will be the smallest among these K elements.
    for(int i = 0; i < K; i++) {
        Heap.push(arr[i]);
    }

    // Step 3: Iterate through the remaining elements (from K to end of array).
    for(int i = K; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        // If the current array element (arr[i]) is GREATER than the smallest
        // element currently in our K-sized heap (Heap.top()).
        if(arr[i] > Heap.top()) {
            Heap.pop();      // Remove the current smallest from the heap (it's not among the K largest).
            Heap.push(arr[i]); // Add the larger element to the heap.
            // This ensures the heap always contains the K largest elements encountered so far.
        }
    }

    // Step 4: After iterating through all elements, the top of the heap
    // (which is the smallest of the K largest elements) will be the Kth largest element overall.

Example Usage:

Input Array: 7 10 4 3 20 15 -1
K: 3

Initial Heap (Min Heap of size K=3):
Elements: 7, 10, 4
Heap: {4, 7, 10} (top is 4)

Process remaining elements:
- Element 3: 3 < Heap.top() (4)
  Ignore. Heap remains: {4, 7, 10}
- Element 20: 20 > Heap.top() (4)
  Pop 4. Push 20. Heap: {7, 10, 20} (top is 7)
- Element 15: 15 > Heap.top() (7)
  Pop 7. Push 15. Heap: {10, 15, 20} (top is 10)

Final Heap.top(): 10
Output: Kth largest element : 10
Wait! The sorted array is {3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20}. The 3rd largest is 15.
Let's re-trace the last step carefully:
Heap: {7, 10, 20} (top is 7)
- Element 15: 15 > Heap.top() (7)
  Pop 7. Push 15.
  The heap elements are now {10, 15, 20}. The smallest of these is 10.
  So Heap.top() should be 10.

Ah, my example trace for K=3, 3rd largest:
Correct sorted array: {3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20}
1st largest: 20
2nd largest: 15
3rd largest: 10

The code logic is correct, the trace showed 10 as the result. My manual trace result was matching the code result.
The interpretation of "3rd largest" might have been slightly off in my mind during manual trace.

### 1\. Problem Statement: Kth Largest Element

  * Given an unsorted array of numbers and an integer `K`, find the element that would be the Kth largest if the array were sorted.
  * Example: `arr = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}`, `K = 3`.
      * Sorted: `{3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20}`.
      * 3rd largest is `15`.

### 2\. Approach: Using a Min Heap of Size K

  * **Core Idea**: We want to find the Kth largest element. If we maintain a collection of the `K` largest elements encountered so far, the smallest among them will be our candidate for the Kth largest.
  * **Why Min Heap?**: A Min Heap is ideal for this because its `top()` element is always the smallest.
      * We maintain a Min Heap of size `K`.
      * This heap will at all times contain the `K` largest elements encountered so far from the input array.
  * **Algorithm Steps**:
    1.  **Initialize Heap**: Insert the first `K` elements from the input array into a `Min Heap`. At this point, the `top()` of the heap is the smallest among these initial `K` elements.
    2.  **Process Remaining Elements**: Iterate through the rest of the array (from index `K` to `arr.size() - 1`).
          * For each `current_element = arr[i]`:
              * **Compare**: If `current_element` is **greater** than `Heap.top()` (the smallest element currently in the heap of `K` largest candidates):
                  * `Heap.pop()`: Remove the current smallest from the heap (since we found a larger one that should be among the `K` largest).
                  * `Heap.push(current_element)`: Insert `current_element` into the heap.
              * If `current_element` is smaller than or equal to `Heap.top()`, it means it's not among the `K` largest elements found so far, so we just ignore it.
    3.  **Result**: After processing all elements, the `Heap.top()` will be the Kth largest element in the entire array. This is because the heap of size `K` will contain the `K` largest elements, and `Heap.top()` will be the smallest among those `K`, which is precisely the Kth largest overall.

### 3\. Complexity Analysis

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N log K)`
      * Initial `K` insertions: `K` operations, each `O(log K)`. Total `O(K log K)`.
      * Remaining `N-K` elements: Each element involves a comparison `O(1)` and potentially a `pop` and `push` (`O(log K)` each). Total `O((N-K) log K)`.
      * Combined: `O(K log K + (N-K) log K) = O(N log K)`.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(K)`
      * The Min Heap stores at most `K` elements.

### 4\. Alternative for Kth Smallest Element

  * If the problem asked for the **Kth smallest element**, you would use a **Max Heap** of size `K`.
  * Logic would be: If `arr[i]` is **smaller** than `maxHeap.top()`, then `maxHeap.pop()` and `maxHeap.push(arr[i])`.
