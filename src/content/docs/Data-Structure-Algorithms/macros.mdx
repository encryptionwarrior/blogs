## Macros:
- Definition:
    - Macros in C++ are preprocessor directives that provide a way to define constants or code snippets that can be reused throughout the program. They are defined using the #define directive.
    - The preprocessor replaces the macro with its definition before the actual compilation process begins.
- Types:
    - Object-like Macros: Used for constants.
    - Function-like Macros: Used for code snippets that look like functions.

##### Syntax:
```c++
#define MACRO_NAME value
#define MACRO_FUNCTION(x) (x * x)
```

##### Example:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#define PI 3.14159       // Object-like macro
#define SQUARE(x) (x * x)  // Function-like macro

int main() {
    int radius = 5;
    // Using the macro
    std::cout << "Area of circle: " << PI * SQUARE(radius) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

###### Pros and Cons of Macros:
- Pros:
    - Efficient because they replace the code before compilation.
    - Useful for constants and small, frequently used operations.
- Cons:
    - No type-checking, which can lead to subtle bugs.
    - Hard to debug since they don't appear in the code after preprocessing.

## Global Variables
##### Definition:
- A global variable is declared outside of all functions and is accessible from any part of the program. Its lifetime is the entire duration of the program.

###### Syntax:
```c++
int globalVar = 10;  // Global variable
void func() {
    std::cout << globalVar;  // Can be accessed inside functions
}
```

###### Example:
```c++
#include <iostream>
int counter = 0;  // Global variable

void increment() {
    counter++;  // Modifying the global variable
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "Counter before increment: " << counter << std::endl;
    increment();
    std::cout << "Counter after increment: " << counter << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

###### Scope and Lifetime:
- Scope: Global variables have a global scope, meaning they are accessible anywhere after their declaration.
- Lifetime: Global variables are allocated memory once, at the start of the program, and are deallocated only when the program terminates.

###### Pros and Cons of Global Variables:
- Pros:
    - Easy access from anywhere in the code.
    - Useful for storing global states.
- Cons:
    - Can lead to tight coupling and dependencies between functions.
    - Harder to debug and track changes.
    - Can cause conflicts with local variables of the same name.

## Inline Functions
Inline functions suggest to the compiler to replace the function call with the actual function code during compilation, thus eliminating the overhead of function calls. This is a hint, and the compiler may or may not inline the function based on optimization criteria.

###### Syntax:
```c++
inline returnType functionName(parameters) {
    // Function body
}
```

###### Example:
```c++
#include <iostream>
inline int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}
int main() {
    std::cout << "Square of 5: " << square(5) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

##### When to Use Inline Functions:
- Small functions: Functions with only a few lines of code (1-2 lines).
- Frequently called functions: To reduce the overhead of function calls in performance-critical applications.

###### Pros and Cons of Inline Functions:
- Pros:
    - Eliminates the function call overhead.
    - Increases performance for small, frequently called functions.
- Cons:
    - Can lead to code bloat if overused, especially for large functions.
    - The compiler might ignore the inline request if the function is too complex.

## Default Arguments
##### Definition:

- Default arguments allow a function to be called with fewer arguments than it is defined with. If an argument is not provided, the default value will be used.
- They simplify function calls by providing default values for some parameters.

###### Syntax:
```c++
returnType functionName(parameter1 = default_value1, parameter2 = default_value2) {
    // Function body
}
```

###### Example:
```c++
#include <iostream>

void greet(std::string name = "Guest", int age = 18) {
    std::cout << "Hello " << name << ", you are " << age << " years old." << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    greet();  // Uses both default arguments
    greet("Alice");  // Uses default age
    greet("Bob", 25);  // Uses provided arguments
    return 0;
}
```

##### Rules for Default Arguments:
- Order matters: Once you provide a default value for one parameter, all subsequent parameters must also have default values.
- Defined from right to left: Only trailing parameters (from the right) can have default values.

###### Pros and Cons of Default Arguments:
- Pros:
    - Reduces the need for overloaded functions.
    - Provides flexibility in function calls.
- Cons:
    - May reduce readability if overused.
    - Harder to track which arguments are being passed or skipped.


#### Key Differences:
| Concept           | Purpose                                                                                   | Example                                                |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Macros            | Define constants or reusable code that gets replaced during preprocessing.                 | `#define PI 3.14159`                                   |
| Global Variables  | Variables accessible from any function in the program.                                     | `int globalVar = 10;`                                  |
| Inline Functions  | Suggests to the compiler to replace function calls with the actual function code to reduce call overhead. | `inline int square(int x) { return x * x; }`           |
| Default Arguments | Allows a function to be called with fewer arguments by providing default values for some parameters. | `void greet(std::string name = "Guest", int age = 18)` |

#### Best Practices:
- Macros: Use macros carefully to avoid bugs, especially for function-like macros. Prefer const or inline functions where possible.
- Global Variables: Limit the use of global variables to avoid tight coupling and global state management issues. Consider alternatives like passing variables by reference.
- Inline Functions: Use inline only for small, frequently called functions. Avoid inlining large functions to prevent code bloat.
- Default Arguments: Use default arguments to reduce the need for overloaded functions, but ensure readability is maintained by keeping function parameters clear.
