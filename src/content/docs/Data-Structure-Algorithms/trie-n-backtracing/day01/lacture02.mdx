```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> // Includes common standard libraries like iostream, vector, string.
using namespace std;     // Use the standard namespace.

// Function to find the longest common prefix among a vector of strings.
// 'str': A vector of strings.
// Time Complexity: O(N * M), where N is number of strings, M is length of shortest string.
// Space Complexity: O(M) for the result string.
string longestCommonPrefix(vector<string> str) {
    // Initialize an empty string to build the longest common prefix.
    string ans = "";

    // Edge case: If the input vector of strings is empty, there's no prefix.
    if (str.empty()) {
        return ans; // Returns ""
    }

    // Iterate through the characters of the first string (str[0]).
    // We assume the LCP cannot be longer than the first string.
    for(int i = 0; i < str[0].length(); i++) {
        // Get the current character from the first string.
        char curr = str[0].at(i);

        // Compare 'curr' with the character at the same position in all other strings.
        // Loop starts from the second string (index 1).
        for(int j = 1; j < str.size(); j++) {
            // Check two conditions for mismatch or end of a string:
            // 1. If the current string 'str[j]' is shorter than 'i' (out of bounds for this char).
            // 2. If the character at position 'i' in 'str[j]' does not match 'curr'.
            if(i >= str[j].length() || str[j].at(i) != curr) {
                // If any of these conditions are true, it means the common prefix ends here.
                // Return the 'ans' accumulated so far.
                return ans;
            }
        }

        // If the character 'curr' passed all comparisons, it's part of the common prefix.
        ans += curr; // Append 'curr' to our result string.
    }

    // If the loop completes, it means the entire first string is the common prefix.
    return ans;
}

int main() {
    vector<string> str; // Declare a vector to store input strings.

    cout << "Enter the strings (enter -1 to stop) : ";
    // Loop to read strings until "-1" is entered.
    while(true) {
        string temp;
        cin >> temp; // Read a string.

        if(temp == "-1") {
            break; // Stop reading if "-1" is entered.
        }

        str.push_back(temp); // Add the string to the vector.
    }

    // Call the function to find the longest common prefix.
    string ans = longestCommonPrefix(str);

    // Print the result.
    cout << "Longest common prefix : " << ans << endl;

    return 0; // Indicate successful execution.
}

### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Given an array (or vector) of strings, find the longest common prefix string amongst them.
  * **Example**:
      * `["flower", "flow", "flight"]` -\> `fl`
      * `["dog", "racecar", "car"]` -\> `""` (empty string)

### 2\. Approach: Character by Character Comparison

  * **Core Idea**: The longest common prefix (LCP) cannot be longer than the shortest string in the input array. We can iterate through the characters of the *first string* and for each character, check if it's present at the same position in *all other strings*.
  * **Algorithm Steps**:
    1.  Initialize an empty string `ans` to store the LCP.
    2.  If the input string array is empty, return `""`. (The provided code handles this implicitly if `str[0]` is accessed; it's good to add an explicit check).
    3.  Iterate through the characters of the *first string* (`str[0]`) from left to right (index `i`).
          * Take the current character `curr` from `str[0].at(i)`.
          * Now, iterate through the *remaining strings* in the array (from `str[1]` to `str[str.size()-1]`).
              * For each string `str[j]`:
                  * Check if `str[j]` is shorter than the current index `i`. If `i` is out of bounds for `str[j]`, it means `str[j]` is shorter than the prefix being built, so the LCP must end here.
                  * Check if `str[j].at(i)` is equal to `curr`.
                  * If either of these conditions fails (out of bounds or character mismatch), it means the common prefix ends at the character *before* `curr`. So, immediately return the `ans` built so far.
          * If the character `curr` is present at the current position `i` in *all* other strings, append `curr` to `ans`.
    4.  After the outer loop finishes (meaning all characters of `str[0]` have been checked and are common prefixes), return `ans`.

### 3\. Complexity Analysis

  * Let `N` be the number of strings in the input vector.
  * Let `M` be the length of the shortest string in the input vector. (In the provided code, `str[0].length()` is used as the upper bound for the outer loop, which implicitly relies on `str[0]` being a candidate for the shortest, or `str[j].at(i)` checking handling shorter strings).
  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N * M)`
      * The outer loop runs up to `M` times (length of the shortest string, or `str[0].length()` in this code).
      * The inner loop runs `N-1` times (for each of the other strings).
      * Inside the inner loop, character comparison is `O(1)`.
      * Total: `M * (N-1) * O(1) = O(N * M)`.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(M)` (for storing the `ans` string, which can be at most the length of the shortest string).

### 4\. Edge Cases

  * **Empty input array**: The code doesn't explicitly handle `str` being empty. If `str` is empty, `str[0]` would cause a runtime error. An initial check `if (str.empty()) return "";` is good practice.
  * **Array with one string**: The loops handle this correctly; the outer loop runs, the inner loop for `j` from 1 to `str.size()` won't execute, and the `ans` will correctly become the first string itself.
  * **Strings with no common prefix**: The loop will immediately return `""` (empty `ans`) on the first character mismatch.
  * **All strings are empty**: The code will return `""`.
