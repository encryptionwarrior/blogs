    // It will cause memory corruption and crashes if nodes are shared prefixes of other words.

                // A node can only be deleted if it is NOT terminal AND has no other children.
                // delete root; // This line should be managed carefully by parent.
                return true; // Word was found and un-marked.

### 1\. What is a Trie?

  * A **Trie** (pronounced "try" or "tree", from *retrieval tree*) is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings or associative array where keys are strings.
  * **Purpose**: Enables efficient retrieval of strings based on prefixes. Common uses include autocomplete, spell checkers, dictionary implementations, and IP routing.
  * **Structure**:
      * Each node in the Trie represents a character.
      * Edges from a node lead to its children, which represent the next characters in a sequence.
      * A word is formed by traversing a path from the root.
      * A special boolean flag (`isTerminal`) at each node indicates if a complete word ends at that node.
  * **Advantages**:
      * Faster lookups than hash tables in worst case (no collisions).
      * Efficient for prefix matching.
      * Alphabetical ordering of keys is implicit.
  * **Disadvantages**:
      * Can consume more memory than hash tables for storing a large number of short strings, especially if the alphabet size is large.

### 2\. `TrieNode` Class

  * **`char data`**: The character this node represents. (Often, the root node stores a null character `'\0'`).
  * **`TrieNode* children[26]`**: An array of pointers to child nodes. The size `26` is for the English alphabet (A-Z or a-z, depending on conversion logic). `children[i]` points to the node for the `i`-th character. `NULL` means no child exists for that character.
  * **`bool isTerminal`**: `true` if a word ends at this node; `false` otherwise. This is crucial to distinguish a prefix from a complete word (e.g., "APP" vs "APPLE").
  * **Constructor**: Initializes `data`, sets `isTerminal` to `false`, and all `children` pointers to `NULL`.

### 3\. `Trie` Class Methods

  * **`Trie()` Constructor**: Initializes the Trie with a `root` node (typically `'\0'`).
  * **`insertUtil(TrieNode* &root, string word)` (Recursive Helper)**:
      * **Base Case**: If `word` is empty, it means we've processed all characters. Set `root->isTerminal = true` to mark the end of a valid word.
      * **Recursive Step**:
        1.  Determine `index` for `word[0]` (e.g., `word[0] - 'A'` for uppercase).
        2.  If `root->children[index]` is `NULL`, create a new `TrieNode` for `word[0]` and link it.
        3.  Recursively call `insertUtil` on this `child` node with the `word.substr(1)` (remaining part).
  * **`insertNode(string word)`**: Public wrapper for `insertUtil`.
  * **`searchUtil(TrieNode* root, string word)` (Recursive Helper)**:
      * **Base Case**: If `word` is empty, return `root->isTerminal`. (If we reached here and this node is terminal, the word exists; otherwise, it's just a prefix).
      * **Recursive Step**:
        1.  Determine `index` for `word[0]`.
        2.  If `root->children[index]` is `NULL`, the character path does not exist. Return `false`.
        3.  Else, recursively call `searchUtil` on the `child` node with `word.substr(1)`.
  * **`search(string word)`**: Public wrapper for `searchUtil`.
  * **`removeUtil(TrieNode* root, string word)` (Logical Deletion)**:
      * **Base Case**: If `word` is empty, and `root->isTerminal` is true, set `root->isTerminal = false`. This *logically* removes the word without deleting nodes.
      * **Recursive Step**: Traverse path. If character path doesn't exist, word isn't there.
  * **`remove(string word)`**: Public wrapper for `removeUtil`.
  * **`eraseUtil(TrieNode* root, string word)` (Physical Deletion - CRITICAL FLAW IN PROVIDED IMPLEMENTATION)**:
      * **Intention**: To physically remove nodes that are no longer part of any word.
      * **Base Case**: If `word` is empty, if `root->isTerminal` is true, set `root->isTerminal = false`. *The provided `delete root;` here is problematic.* You should only delete a node if it's no longer part of any *other* word AND has no other children.
      * **Recursive Step**:
          * Traverse to the child.
          * `bool ans = eraseUtil(child, word.substr(1));` - The return value `ans` here indicates if the word was found and marked non-terminal.
          * **`delete child;`**: This line is the major flaw. If `child` has other children (meaning it's a prefix for another word like "APP" is for "APPLE"), or if `child` is itself a terminal node for another word, deleting it will corrupt the Trie.
      * **Correct Physical Deletion Logic (Conceptual)**:
        1.  Perform a logical removal (`isTerminal = false`).
        2.  After the recursive call returns, check the `child` node:
              * Is `child->isTerminal` `false`? (No other word ends here).
              * Does `child` have *no other children* (i.e., all `children[i]` are `NULL`)?
              * If both conditions are true, then it's safe to `delete child`.
              * Also, if a node is deleted, its parent's pointer to it must be set to `NULL`.
  * **`erase(string word)`**: Public wrapper for `eraseUtil`. **Be cautious using the provided `erase` due to the mentioned flaw.**

### 4\. Complexity Analysis

  * Let `L` be the length of the word being inserted/searched/removed.
  * Let `A` be the size of the alphabet (e.g., 26 for English letters).
  * **Insertion**: `O(L)` - We traverse `L` nodes, and each step is `O(1)` (array access).
  * **Search**: `O(L)` - Similar traversal.
  * **Removal (`remove` - logical deletion)**: `O(L)` - Similar traversal to find and update `isTerminal`.
  * **Erasure (`erase` - physical deletion with flawed implementation)**: `O(L)` for traversal, but leads to incorrect behavior and potential crashes. A correctly implemented physical deletion would also be `O(L)`.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(Total_Characters_Stored * A)` or `O(Total_Nodes_in_Trie * A)`. In the worst case (no common prefixes), it's `O(Sum_of_Lengths_of_All_Words * A)`.
