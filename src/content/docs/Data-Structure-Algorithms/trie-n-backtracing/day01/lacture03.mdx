### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Given a vector of strings, find the longest string that is a prefix of all strings in the vector.

### 2\. Approach: Trie Data Structure

  * **Core Idea**: Insert all the given strings into a Trie. The longest common prefix will correspond to the longest path from the Trie's root where every node on that path has:
      * Exactly one child.
      * Is not marked as a terminal node (meaning a complete word ends there), unless it's the actual LCP itself. (The code handles this by breaking if it *is* a terminal node, as the LCP can't extend past a full word that forms the common prefix).
  * **TrieNode Enhancement**: To efficiently check the "exactly one child" condition, each `TrieNode` needs an additional field:
      * `int childCount`: Stores the number of active children (non-NULL pointers) for that node. This is incremented when a new child is created and linked.

### 3\. Algorithm Steps

1.  **Build Trie**:
      * Create an empty `Trie`.
      * Iterate through each string in the input `vector<string>`.
      * For each string, insert it into the Trie using the `insertNode` method.
      * Ensure that during insertion, the `childCount` of a node is incremented *only* when a `new TrieNode` is created for a character.
2.  **Find LCP**:
      * Initialize an empty string `ans`.
      * Start traversing from the `root` of the Trie (`TrieNode* temp = t->root;`).
      * Iterate through the characters of the *first string* (`str[0]`). This string serves as a reference path, as the LCP must be a prefix of it.
      * For each character `str[0][i]` at index `i`:
          * **Check `childCount`**: If `temp->childCount == 1`:
              * This means all strings currently sharing this path continue with the same character.
              * Append `str[0][i]` to `ans`.
              * Move `temp` to its *only* child node corresponding to `str[0][i]`.
          * **Else (`childCount != 1`)**:
              * This means either there are multiple branches (strings diverge) or no further children (end of common path). Break the loop.
          * **Check `isTerminal`**: After updating `ans` and moving `temp` to the child node, check `if (temp->isTerminal)`.
              * If `temp->isTerminal` is `true`, it means a complete word ends at this point. The LCP cannot extend beyond a word boundary that is a part of the common prefix. Break the loop. (e.g., if "apple", "app", "apricot" are inserted, the LCP is "ap". When 'p' of "app" is reached, `isTerminal` is true. We break).
      * Return the accumulated `ans` string.

### 4\. Complexity Analysis

  * Let `N` be the number of strings.

  * Let `L_avg` be the average length of the strings.

  * Let `L_min` be the length of the shortest string.

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N * L_avg)`

      * **Building the Trie**: Inserting `N` strings, each of average length `L_avg`, takes `O(N * L_avg)` time because each character insertion is `O(1)`.
      * **Finding LCP**: Traversing the Trie to find the LCP takes `O(L_min)` time, as we only traverse down the common path.
      * **Total**: The dominant factor is building the Trie, so overall `O(N * L_avg)`.

  * **Space Complexity**: `O(Total_Characters_in_All_Words)` or `O(Sum_of_Lengths_of_All_Strings)` in the worst case (if strings have no common prefixes, e.g., "a", "b", "c").

      * In the best case (all strings are identical), it's `O(L_max)`.

### 5\. Edge Cases

  * **Empty input array**: The code should handle `str.empty()` at the start of `longestCommonPrefix` to avoid accessing `str[0]`.
  * **Strings with no common prefix**: The `childCount == 1` condition will likely fail immediately at the root's first child, returning `""`.
  * **All strings are empty**: The LCP will correctly be `""`.
