### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Place `N` non-attacking queens on an `N x N` chessboard. A queen can attack horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
  * **Output**: Find all distinct configurations of queens. Each configuration is represented as an `N x N` board where `1` indicates a queen and `0` indicates an empty cell.
  * **Key Constraint**: No two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

### 2\. Approach: Backtracking

  * **Core Idea**: The N-Queens problem is a classic example of how backtracking can be used. We try to place queens one column at a time. For each column, we iterate through all possible rows. If placing a queen at `(row, col)` is "safe" (doesn't conflict with previously placed queens), we place it and recursively try to place the next queen in the next column. If a placement leads to no solution (or we cannot place a queen in a subsequent column), we "backtrack" by removing the queen and trying a different row.

### 3\. Algorithm Steps

1.  **`isSafe(row, col, board, n)` Function**:

      * Checks if placing a queen at `(row, col)` is safe, given the queens already placed in columns `0` to `col-1`.
      * **Assumptions**: Since we place queens column by column from left to right, we only need to check:
          * **Same Row**: Check cells to the left in the current `row`.
          * **Upper Left Diagonal**: Check cells diagonally up-left.
          * **Lower Left Diagonal**: Check cells diagonally down-left.
      * The current code passes `board` by value (`vector<vector<int>> board`), which causes a full copy of the board for each `isSafe` call, leading to performance issues for larger `N`. It's better to pass it by `const &` or, even better, optimize checks using auxiliary arrays (see "Optimizations" below).

2.  **`solve(col, solution, board, n)` (Recursive Backtracking Function)**:

      * **Parameters**:
          * `col`: The current column we are trying to place a queen in.
          * `solution`: `vector<vector<int>>` to store all valid board configurations.
          * `board`: The current `N x N` chessboard state (passed by reference so changes are reflected).
          * `n`: Size of the board.
      * **Base Case**: If `col == n`:
          * This means we have successfully placed a queen in every column (from `0` to `n-1`).
          * A valid configuration is found. Add the current `board` to `solution` using `addSolution` and `return`.
      * **Recursive Step**:
          * Iterate through each `row` from `0` to `n-1` in the current `col`.
          * For each `row`:
              * **Check Safety**: Call `isSafe(row, col, board, n)`.
              * **If Safe**:
                  * **Make a Move**: Place a queen: `board[row][col] = 1`.
                  * **Recurse**: Call `solve(col + 1, solution, board, n)` to try placing the next queen in the next column.
                  * **Backtrack**: After the recursive call returns (meaning all possibilities from this placement have been explored), `undo` the move: `board[row][col] = 0`. This allows trying other rows in the current column.

3.  **`addSolution(board, sol)` Function**:

      * This helper converts the `N x N` `board` (2D vector) into a flattened 1D `vector<int>` (e.g., `[0,0,1,0, 1,0,0,0, ...]` for an 8x8 board) and adds it to the `sol` (all solutions) vector.

4.  **`nQueens(int n)` Function**:

      * Initializes an empty `solution` vector.
      * Initializes an empty `N x N` `board` with all `0`s.
      * Calls the recursive `solve` function starting from `col = 0`.
      * Returns the `solution` vector.

### 4\. Optimizations for `isSafe` (Important for Performance)

The `isSafe` function as written has `O(N)` complexity per call (due to three loops), and it makes `O(N)` copies of the board if passed by value. This makes the overall complexity very high.

A better way to check safety is to use three boolean arrays/vectors:

  * `rowCheck[N]`: `rowCheck[r]` is true if a queen is in `row r`.
  * `upperDiagonalCheck[2*N - 1]`: `upperDiagonalCheck[r + c]` is true if a queen is on the upper diagonal `r + c`.
  * `lowerDiagonalCheck[2*N - 1]`: `lowerDiagonalCheck[n - 1 + r - c]` is true if a queen is on the lower diagonal `n - 1 + r - c`.

Using these arrays, `isSafe` becomes `O(1)`. Update them when placing/removing a queen.

### 5\. Complexity Analysis

  * Let `N` be the size of the chessboard.

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N!)`

      * In the worst case (unoptimized `isSafe`): Each `solve` call iterates `N` times for rows. Inside, `isSafe` takes `O(N)`. This gives a rough upper bound of `O(N * N!)` or even worse with pass-by-value.
      * With optimized `isSafe` (using boolean arrays for `O(1)` checks): The `solve` function essentially explores `N` branches at each level. The number of leaf nodes (solutions) is part of `N!`. The complexity is roughly `O(N!)`. `O(N^2 * N!)` if board copying is included in `addSolution` and `isSafe` not optimized. The actual number of recursive calls is related to the number of nodes in the implicit state-space tree.
      * The `addSolution` function copies an `N x N` board, which takes `O(N^2)` time per solution found. If `S` is the number of solutions, this adds `O(S * N^2)` to the total.

  * **Space Complexity**: `O(N^2)`

      * `board`: `O(N^2)`.
      * Recursion stack depth: `O(N)` (for `N` recursive calls).
      * `solution`: `O(S * N^2)` where `S` is the number of solutions. This can be large (exponential with `N`).
      * Optimized `isSafe` would add `O(N)` space for the three boolean arrays.

### 6\. Key Concepts

  * **Backtracking**: Incremental construction of solutions; pruning branches that cannot lead to a solution.
  * **Recursion**: The problem has optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, making recursion a natural fit.
  * **State Space Tree**: The implicit tree representing all possible queen placements. Backtracking prunes branches of this tree.
