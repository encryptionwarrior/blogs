### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Place `N` non-attacking queens on an `N x N` chessboard. A queen can attack horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
  * **Output**: Find all distinct configurations of queens. Each configuration is represented as an `N x N` board where `1` indicates a queen and `0` indicates an empty cell.
  * **Key Constraint**: No two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

### 2\. Approach: Backtracking with `O(1)` Safety Checks

  * **Core Idea**: This is an optimized version of the standard backtracking solution. Instead of iterating through parts of the board to check for conflicts (which is `O(N)` per check), we use auxiliary data structures (hash maps or boolean arrays) to keep track of occupied rows and diagonals. This allows `isSafe` checks to be performed in `O(1)` time.
  * **Conflict Conditions**:
      * **Same Row**: A queen at `(r, c)` conflicts with any other queen in `row r`.
      * **Same Column**: A queen at `(r, c)` conflicts with any other queen in `column c`. (We avoid this by placing only one queen per column).
      * **Upper-Left to Lower-Right Diagonal**: Cells `(r, c)` on this diagonal have a constant sum of `r + c`.
      * **Upper-Right to Lower-Left Diagonal**: Cells `(r, c)` on this diagonal have a constant difference of `r - c`. To handle negative differences, we can use `n - 1 + r - c` (or just `r - c` and adjust map/array indexing).

### 3\. Algorithm Steps

1.  **Global/Auxiliary Data Structures**:

      * `map<int, bool> rowCheck`: Maps row index `r` to `true` if `row r` has a queen.
      * `map<int, bool> upperCheck`: Maps diagonal sum `r + c` to `true` if that upper-left to lower-right diagonal has a queen.
      * `map<int, bool> lowerCheck`: Maps transformed diagonal difference `n + r - c` (or `r - c` appropriately handled) to `true` if that upper-right to lower-left diagonal has a queen. The code uses `n+row-col` as the key for `lowerCheck` which corresponds to `upper-right to lower-left` diagonals. *Self-correction: The code's `lowerCheck` variable name for `row+col` and `upperCheck` for `n+row-col` might be confusing, but the logic for checking these two distinct diagonal types is correct.*
          * `row + col`: For diagonals that run from top-left to bottom-right (constant sum).
          * `row - col`: For diagonals that run from top-right to bottom-left (constant difference). Adding `n-1` to `row - col` can shift indices to be non-negative: `(n - 1) + row - col`. The provided code uses `n + row - col` for this.

2.  **`isSafe(row, col, n)` Function**:

      * Checks if placing a queen at `(row, col)` is safe.
      * It directly queries the `rowCheck`, `upperCheck`, and `lowerCheck` maps/arrays.
      * Returns `true` if none of these maps indicate a conflict (`false` if `true` in any).
      * Complexity: `O(1)` (average for map, strict `O(1)` for array).

3.  **`solve(col, solution, board, n)` (Recursive Backtracking Function)**:

      * **Base Case**: If `col == n`, all `N` queens are placed. Add `board` to `solution` and `return`.
      * **Recursive Step**:
          * Iterate through each `row` from `0` to `n-1` in the current `col`.
          * **Check Safety**: Call `isSafe(row, col, n)`. (Note: `isSafe` no longer needs `board` as a parameter due to global checks).
          * **If Safe**:
              * **Make a Move**: Place queen on `board[row][col] = 1`.
              * **Update Auxiliary Arrays**: Mark `rowCheck[row]`, `upperCheck[row+col]`, and `lowerCheck[n+row-col]` as `true`.
              * **Recurse**: Call `solve(col + 1, solution, board, n)`.
              * **Backtrack**:
                  * Unplace queen on board: `board[row][col] = 0`.
                  * Reset auxiliary arrays: Mark `rowCheck[row]`, `upperCheck[row+col]`, and `lowerCheck[n+row-col]` as `false`.

4.  **`addSolution(board, sol)` Function**:

      * Same as before: Converts 2D `board` to a flattened 1D `vector<int>` and adds to `sol`.

5.  **`nQueens(int n)` Function**:

      * Initializes `solution` and `board`.
      * Crucially, **clears the global maps (`rowCheck`, `upperCheck`, `lowerCheck`)** before starting `solve(0, ...)`. This ensures a fresh state for each call to `nQueens`. (The provided code doesn't explicitly clear them; if `nQueens` is called multiple times, this could be an issue. For a single call from `main`, it's fine).
      * Calls `solve(0, solution, board, n)`.
      * Returns `solution`.

### 4\. Complexity Analysis

  * Let `N` be the size of the chessboard.

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N!)` (Theoretically, as it explores valid permutations).

      * The `O(1)` `isSafe` check significantly speeds up the process compared to the `O(N)` version.
      * The `addSolution` still takes `O(N^2)` time per solution. If `S` is the number of solutions, this adds `O(S * N^2)` to the total.
      * Overall complexity is dominated by the nature of the problem, which is to find all permutations, hence `O(N!)` with constant factor from checks and board updates.

  * **Space Complexity**: `O(N^2)`

      * `board`: `O(N^2)`.
      * Recursion stack depth: `O(N)`.
      * `solution`: `O(S * N^2)` where `S` is the number of solutions.
      * Auxiliary maps/arrays (`rowCheck`, `upperCheck`, `lowerCheck`): `O(N)` for `rowCheck`, and `O(2*N - 1)` for each diagonal check, totaling `O(N)` auxiliary space.

### 5\. Benefits of Optimization

  * **Significant Speedup**: For larger `N`, the difference between `O(N!)` and `O(N * N!)` is immense.
  * **Cleaner `isSafe`**: The logic in `isSafe` becomes much simpler and more direct.
