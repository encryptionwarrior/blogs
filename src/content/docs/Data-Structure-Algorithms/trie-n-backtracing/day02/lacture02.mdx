### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Given a square maze (represented as a 2D grid) where `1` represents an open path and `0` represents a blocked cell, find all possible paths for a rat to travel from the top-left corner (0,0) to the bottom-right corner (n-1, n-1).
  * **Movement Rules**: The rat can move in four directions: Down (`D`), Left (`L`), Right (`R`), Up (`U`).
  * **Constraints**:
      * The rat cannot move into a blocked cell (`0`).
      * The rat cannot move out of bounds of the maze.
      * The rat cannot revisit a cell within the *same path*.

### 2\. Approach: Backtracking (Depth-First Search - DFS)

  * **Core Idea**: Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally. If a partial solution cannot be completed into a valid solution, it "backtracks" (undoes its last step) and tries a different path.
  * **Algorithm Steps**:
    1.  **State Representation**:
          * `maze`: The input 2D grid representing the maze.
          * `visited`: A 2D grid of the same size as `maze`, initialized with `0`s. `visited[x][y] = 1` means cell `(x,y)` is part of the current path being explored. This prevents cycles.
          * `path`: A string that stores the sequence of moves (`D`, `L`, `R`, `U`) for the current path being explored.
          * `x, y`: Current coordinates of the rat.
          * `n`: Size of the maze (n x n).
          * `answer`: A `vector<string>` to store all valid paths found.
    2.  **`isSafe(maze, visited, n, newX, newY)` Function**:
          * Checks if a proposed next move `(newX, newY)` is valid:
              * Within maze boundaries (`0 <= newX < n` and `0 <= newY < n`).
              * The cell `maze[newX][newY]` is open (`1`).
              * The cell `visited[newX][newY]` has not been visited in the current path (`0`).
    3.  **`paths(answer, maze, visited, path, x, y, n)` (Recursive Backtracking Function)**:
          * **Base Case**: If the rat reaches the destination `(x == n-1 && y == n-1)`, it means a valid path has been found. Add the current `path` string to `answer` and `return`.
          * **Recursive Step**:
              * Mark the current cell `(x, y)` as visited: `visited[x][y] = 1`. (Note: The code does this *before* moving into the new cell, which is typical for the entry point of a recursive call. The initial `(0,0)` needs to be marked before the first moves are attempted).
              * **Try each of the four directions (D, L, R, U) in a specific order**:
                  * For each direction:
                      * Calculate `newX`, `newY`.
                      * If `isSafe(maze, visited, n, newX, newY)`:
                          * **Make a move**: Add the move character (`'D'`, `'L'`, `'R'`, `'U'`) to `path`.
                          * **Recurse**: Call `paths` with the new coordinates and updated path.
                          * **Backtrack**: After the recursive call returns (meaning that path segment has been fully explored), *undo* the move:
                              * Set `visited[newX][newY] = 0` (unmark the cell as visited for *future* paths).
                              * `path.pop_back()` (remove the last character from `path`).
              * (The current code structure has the `visited[x][y] = 1` mark and `path.push_back()` inside the `if(isSafe)` block *after* calculating `newX`, `newY`. This means `(0,0)` is not marked as visited initially inside `paths` before its first moves are tried. It implicitly gets marked when the first valid move from (0,0) happens. A more standard way is to mark `x,y` as visited right at the start of `paths` and unmark at the end, before trying any directions, but this code's approach also works by marking *next* cell as visited.)
    4.  **`searchMaze(arr, n)` Function**:
          * Initializes a `visited` matrix with all `0`s.
          * Initializes an empty `answer` vector.
          * **Important Check**: If the starting cell `arr[0][0]` is blocked (`0`), no path is possible.
          * Calls the recursive `paths` function starting from `(0,0)` with an empty path string.
          * Returns the `answer` vector containing all found paths.

### 3\. Complexity Analysis

  * Let `N` be the size of the maze (N x N grid).
  * **Time Complexity**:
      * In the worst case, the rat might explore every possible path. Since each cell can be visited (or not) and each path can have up to `N*N` cells, and there are 4 choices at each step, the theoretical upper bound can be exponential `O(4^(N*N))`.
      * However, because `visited` array prevents revisiting cells within a *single path*, the actual complexity is significantly less. It's closer to the number of valid paths multiplied by the length of the path.
      * A tighter bound for similar problems can be `O(3^(N^2))` or `O(2^(N^2))`, but for typical mazes, it is much faster. It effectively explores a tree of paths.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(N*N)`
      * `visited` matrix: `O(N*N)`.
      * Recursion stack depth: `O(N*N)` (maximum path length).
      * `answer` vector: `O(P * L)` where `P` is the number of valid paths and `L` is the maximum path length. This can also be exponential in the worst case (e.g., a completely open maze).

### 4\. Key Concepts

  * **Backtracking**: A general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, especially constraint satisfaction problems. It incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.
  * **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Backtracking is often implemented using DFS. We explore one path to its fullest extent before trying alternative branches.
  * **State Space Tree**: The set of all possible paths that the rat can take can be visualized as a tree, where nodes are states (rat's position, current path, visited cells) and edges are moves. Backtracking explores this tree.
