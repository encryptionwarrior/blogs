### 1\. Problem Statement

  * **Goal**: Implement an autocomplete or phone directory-like functionality. Given a list of contact names (strings) and a search query string, for each prefix of the query, return all contacts that start with that prefix.
  * **Example**:
      * `contactList = ["geek", "geeks", "geometry", "apple"]`, `query = "ge"`
      * For "g": ["geek", "geeks", "geometry"]
      * For "ge": ["geek", "geeks", "geometry"]

### 2\. Approach: Trie Data Structure

  * **Core Idea**: A Trie is ideal for prefix-based searches. By storing all contact names in a Trie, we can efficiently traverse paths corresponding to query prefixes and collect all words within the subtrees.
  * **TrieNode Structure**:
      * `char data`: The character stored in the node.
      * `TrieNode* children[26]`: An array of pointers to child nodes, representing the next possible characters (e.g., 'a' through 'z').
      * `bool isTerminal`: A flag indicating if a complete word ends at this node.

### 3\. Key Functions & Logic

#### a. `TrieNode` Class:

  * Standard constructor to initialize `data`, `isTerminal` to `false`, and all `children` pointers to `NULL`.

#### b. `Trie` Class:

  * **Constructor**: Initializes the `root` node of the Trie (typically with a null character `'\0'`).
  * **`insertUtil(TrieNode* root, string word)` (Recursive Helper)**:
      * **Base Case**: If `word` is empty, set `root->isTerminal = true`.
      * **Recursive Step**:
        1.  Determine `index` for `word[0]` (e.g., `word[0] - 'a'` for lowercase).
        2.  If `children[index]` is `NULL`, create a new `TrieNode` and link it.
        3.  Recursively call `insertUtil` on the `child` node with `word.substr(1)`.
  * **`insertNode(string word)`**: Public wrapper for `insertUtil`.

#### c. `printSuggetions(TrieNode* curr, vector<string> &temp, string prefix)` (Recursive DFS)

  * **Purpose**: This function performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from `curr` node to find all complete words in its subtree.
  * **`temp`**: A `vector<string>` passed by reference to collect the suggestions.
  * **`prefix`**: The string built so far from the root to the `curr` node.
  * **Base Case**: If `curr->isTerminal` is `true`, it means the `prefix` currently built forms a complete word. Add `prefix` to `temp`.
  * **Recursive Step**:
    1.  Iterate through all possible characters ('a' to 'z').
    2.  If `curr->children[index]` (for character `ch`) is not `NULL`:
          * Append `ch` to the current `prefix`.
          * Recursively call `printSuggetions` on `curr->children[index]`.
          * After the recursive call returns, `pop_back` from `prefix` to backtrack (remove `ch`) for exploring other branches.

#### d. `getSuggestions(TrieNode* root, string query)`

  * **Purpose**: Orchestrates the suggestion process for the entire `query`.
  * It iterates through each character of the `query` (from left to right):
    1.  For the current character `lastChar`, it updates the `prefix` string.
    2.  It attempts to move down the Trie from the `prev` node (initially `root`) to `curr` (the child corresponding to `lastChar`).
    3.  **If `curr == NULL`**: This means the current `query` prefix is not found in any contact. No further suggestions can be made for longer prefixes. The loop `break`s.
    4.  **If `curr` is found**: Call `printSuggetions(curr, temp, prefix)` to gather all words starting with the current `prefix`. Add these `temp` suggestions to the `answer` (which is a `vector<vector<string>>`). Clear `temp` for the next prefix.
    5.  Update `prev = curr` to continue traversal for the next character of the query.
  * Returns the `answer` (a list of suggestion lists for each prefix length).

#### e. `phoneDirectory(vector<string> contactList, string query)`

  * This is the top-level function.
  * It first constructs a `Trie` by inserting all `contactList` strings.
  * Then, it calls `getSuggestions` with the Trie's `root` and the `query` string.

### 4\. Complexity Analysis

  * Let `N` be the number of contacts in `contactList`.

  * Let `L_avg` be the average length of a contact string.

  * Let `Q` be the length of the `query` string.

  * Let `S_i` be the number of suggestions for prefix of length `i`, and `L_sug_i_avg` be their average length.

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N * L_avg + Q * (Nodes_in_Subtree_for_matching_prefix + Sum_of_Lengths_of_All_Suggestions_for_that_prefix))`

      * **Building Trie**: `O(Sum of lengths of all contacts)`. Each insertion of a string of length `L` is `O(L)`.
      * **`getSuggestions`**: The outer loop runs `Q` times. Inside the loop, `printSuggetions` performs a DFS on a subtree.
          * The time for `printSuggetions` is roughly proportional to the number of nodes in the subtree it traverses plus the total length of all strings it collects.
          * In the worst case, if all contacts share a long common prefix and there are many suggestions, this could be significant.
          * A more precise bound is `O(Sum of lengths of all contacts + Sum over each prefix 'p' of query 'Q' of (number of nodes visited in Trie for 'p' + total characters in all suggested words for 'p'))`. This is typically very efficient for practical autocomplete scenarios.

  * **Space Complexity**:

      * **Trie Storage**: `O(Total characters in all distinct contact names)`.
      * **`answer` vector**: `O(Q * S_max * L_sug_avg)` where `S_max` is max suggestions and `L_sug_avg` is average length, as all suggestions for all prefixes are stored.
