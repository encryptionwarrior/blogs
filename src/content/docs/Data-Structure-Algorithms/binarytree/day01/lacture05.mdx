        q.pop();                   // Remove it from the queue

        // IMPORTANT: Push right child first, then left child.
        // This ensures that when popped from the stack, they appear left-to-right.
        // However, since we're reversing at the end, if we want right-to-left within level,
        // we push left child first then right child here.
        // Let's go with standard level order into stack, then stack pops for reverse order.

/*
Example INPUT for buildTree function:
1 2 4 -1 -1 5 -1 -1 3 6 -1 -1 7 -1 -1

This input creates a tree structure like this:
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \ / \
    4  5 6  7

Standard Level Order: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Reverse Level Order (as implemented here: bottom-up, right-to-left within level): 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
(If you push Left then Right to queue, the within-level order would be Left-to-Right.
The current code pushes Right then Left to queue, so the stack pops Right-to-Left within a level)

### 1\. Binary Tree Node Structure

  * A `Node` in a Binary Tree typically consists of:
      * `data`: The value stored in the node.
      * `left`: A pointer to the left child node.
      * `right`: A pointer to the right child node.

### 2\. `buildTree(Node* root)` (Recursive Pre-order Build)

  * **Logic**: Builds the tree recursively by taking input in a pre-order fashion (Root -\> Left -\> Right).
  * Uses `-1` as a sentinel value to indicate a `NULL` child (base case for recursion).
  * **Use Case**: Useful when you want to construct a tree directly from a pre-order sequence where `NULL` nodes are explicitly marked.

### 3\. Reverse Level Order Traversal

  * **Definition**: Traverses the tree level by level, but from the **last level up to the root**, and for each level, from **right to left**.

  * It's essentially a Level Order Traversal (BFS) where the results are stored and then printed in reverse.

  * **Algorithm (Using Auxiliary Queue and Stack)**:

    1.  Initialize an empty `queue<Node*>` (for standard BFS).
    2.  Initialize an empty `stack<Node*>` (to store nodes in reverse order of visit).
    3.  If the `root` is `NULL`, return.
    4.  Enqueue the `root` node into the queue.
    5.  While the queue is not empty:
        a.  Dequeue a node (`temp`) from the queue.
        b.  Push `temp` onto the `stack`. This accumulates nodes level by level.
        c.  **IMPORTANT**: Enqueue the `right` child first, then the `left` child (if they exist). This ensures that when nodes are popped from the stack, children are printed from right to left within a level.
    6.  After the queue becomes empty, all nodes are in the stack.
    7.  While the `stack` is not empty:
        a.  Pop a node from the stack.
        b.  Print its data.
        This prints nodes from the last level to the root, and from right to left within each level.

### 4\. Complexity Analysis

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`
      * Each node is enqueued and dequeued once from the queue.
      * Each node is pushed and popped once from the stack.
      * Total operations are proportional to N.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(N)`
      * The `queue` stores nodes up to the maximum width of the tree (O(W)).
      * The `stack` stores all N nodes (O(N)).
      * Therefore, the overall space complexity is `O(N)`.
