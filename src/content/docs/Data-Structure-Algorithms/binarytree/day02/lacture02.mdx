```cpp

#include "BinaryTree.h"  // Assumed to contain Node class and buildTree function definitions

using namespace std;     // Uses the standard namespace

// Helper function to calculate the height of a Binary Tree recursively
// Height is defined as the number of nodes on the longest path from the root to a leaf.
int getHeight(Node* root) {
    // Base Case: If the current node is NULL (empty subtree), its height is 0.

    // Option 2: Diameter lies entirely in the right subtree
    int d2 = getDiameter(root->right);
    // Option 3: Diameter passes through the current root node
    // It's the height of left subtree + height of right subtree + 1 (for the root itself)

    // Option 3: Diameter passing through the current node
    // This is the height of left subtree + height of right subtree + 1 (for the current node)
    int opt3 = leftResult.second + rightResult.second + 1;

    // The overall diameter for the current subtree is the maximum of these three options.

    Node* root = NULL; // Initialize the root of the tree to NULL

    // Build the tree. 'buildTree' function is assumed to be defined in "BinaryTree.h"

    // This creates:
    //      1

    //    2   3
    //   / \ / \
    //  4  5 6  7

    // Uncomment the next line to use the less optimized diameter calculation

/*
Example INPUTs for buildTree function (for reference):

1.  Input: 3 4 -1 -1 6 -1 -1
    Tree Structure:
            3
           / \
          4   6
    Height: 2
    Diameter: 2 (path 4-3-6)

2.  Input: 1 2 4 -1 -1 5 -1 -1 3 6 -1 -1 7 -1 -1
    Tree Structure:
            1
           / \
          2   3
         / \ / \
        4  5 6  7
    Height: 3
    Diameter: 5 (path 4-2-1-3-7 or 5-2-1-3-6, etc.)

3.  Input: 8 2 4 -1 -1 6 2 -1 -1 5 -1 -1 5 -1 9 -1 6 4 2 -1 -1 3 -1 -1 7 -1 -1
    This is a very long pre-order sequence, designed to test more complex trees.
    The diameter will depend on the longest path in the tree formed by this input.

### 1\. Binary Tree Node Structure

  * A `Node` in a Binary Tree typically consists of:
      * `data`: The value stored in the node.
      * `left`: A pointer to the left child node.
      * `right`: A pointer to the right child node.

### 2\. Height of a Binary Tree (`getHeight` function)

  * **Definition**: The height of a binary tree is the **number of nodes** on the longest path from the root node to any leaf node. (An empty tree has height 0, a single node tree has height 1).
  * **Logic**: Recursively, the height of a node is `1 + max(height_of_left_subtree, height_of_right_subtree)`.
  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N)` (each node visited once).
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(H)` (recursion stack, H = height).

### 3\. Diameter of a Binary Tree

  * **Definition**: The diameter of a binary tree is the **length of the longest path between any two nodes** in the tree. This path may or may not pass through the root of the entire tree.
  * **Key Insight**: The longest path between two nodes in any subtree (rooted at `X`) can be one of three types:
    1.  The path lies entirely within `X`'s **left subtree**.
    2.  The path lies entirely within `X`'s **right subtree**.
    3.  The path **passes through `X`**. In this case, its length is `Height(left_subtree_of_X) + Height(right_subtree_of_X) + 1` (the `+1` is for node `X` itself).
  * The overall diameter of the tree is the maximum of these three values, considered for *every node* in the tree.

### 4\. Approaches to Calculate Diameter

#### a) `getDiameter(Node* root)` (Naive/Less Optimized)

  * **Logic**:
      * Recursively calculates the diameter of the left subtree (`d1`) and the right subtree (`d2`).
      * Calculates the path through the current `root` (`d3`) by summing `getHeight(left_child)` and `getHeight(right_child)` and adding `1`.
      * Returns the maximum of `d1`, `d2`, and `d3`.
  * **Drawback**: This approach involves redundant calculations. For each node, `getHeight` is called on its children, and `getHeight` itself traverses subtrees. This means the same subtrees are traversed multiple times.
  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N^2)` in the worst case (e.g., a skewed tree where `getHeight` is called on every node for every ancestor). In best case (balanced), it can be better but still often worse than `O(N)`.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(H)` (recursion stack).

#### b) `getDiameterOptimised(Node* root)` (Optimized)

  * **Logic**: This approach calculates **both the diameter and the height** for each subtree in a single recursive traversal.
  * **Return Type**: It typically returns a `pair<int, int>` where:
      * `pair.first` represents the `diameter` of the subtree rooted at the current node.
      * `pair.second` represents the `height` of the subtree rooted at the current node.
  * **Algorithm**:
    1.  **Base Case**: If `root` is `NULL`, return `{0, 0}` (diameter 0, height 0).
    2.  **Recursive Calls**: Recursively call `getDiameterOptimised` for `left` and `right` children to get their `(diameter, height)` pairs.
    3.  **Calculate Current Node's Height**: `current_height = max(left_pair.second, right_pair.second) + 1`.
    4.  **Calculate Current Node's Diameter**:
          * `option1 = left_pair.first` (diameter from left subtree)
          * `option2 = right_pair.first` (diameter from right subtree)
          * `option3 = left_pair.second + right_pair.second + 1` (path passing through current node)
          * `current_diameter = max(option1, max(option2, option3))`
    5.  **Return**: Return `{current_diameter, current_height}`.
  * **Advantage**: By returning both height and diameter from each recursive call, redundant `getHeight` calculations are avoided.
  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`
      * Each node is visited exactly once.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(H)` (recursion stack).
