title: Height Of Binary Tree
description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> // Includes common standard libraries (like iostream, algorithm for max)
#include "BinaryTree.h"  // Assumed to contain Node class and buildTree function definitions

using namespace std;     // Uses the standard namespace

// Function to calculate the height of a Binary Tree recursively
// Height is defined as the number of nodes on the longest path from the root to a leaf.
int getHeight(Node* root) {
    // Base Case: If the current node is NULL (empty subtree), its height is 0.
    if(root == NULL) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Recursively get the height of the left subtree
    int leftHeight = getHeight(root->left);
    // Recursively get the height of the right subtree
    int rightHeight = getHeight(root->right);

    // The height of the current node is 1 (for itself)
    // plus the maximum of the heights of its left and right subtrees.
    int answer = max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    return answer;
}

int main() {
    Node* root = NULL; // Initialize the root of the tree to NULL

    // Build the tree. 'buildTree' function is assumed to be defined in "BinaryTree.h"
    // It typically takes input in a pre-order fashion (e.g., 1 3 7 -1 -1 11 -1 -1 5 17 -1 -1 -1)
    root = buildTree(root);

    // Calculate the height of the constructed tree
    int height = getHeight(root);

    // Print the calculated height
    cout << endl << "Height / Depth of the tree is : " << height << endl;

    return 0; // End of the program
}

/*
Example INPUTs for buildTree function (for reference):

1.  Input: 3 4 -1 -1 6 -1 -1
    Tree Structure:
            3
           / \
          4   6
    Height Calculation:
    - getHeight(4) = 1
    - getHeight(6) = 1
    - getHeight(3) = max(1, 1) + 1 = 2
    Output: Height / Depth of the tree is : 2

2.  Input: 5 4 2 -1 6 -1 -1 7 -1 8 -1 9 -1 -1 10 -1 -1
    Tree Structure:
              5
             / \
            4   10
           / \
          2   7
         / \ / \
        -  6 8  9
    (Assuming -1 means no child)
    Height for this tree is 4 (path 5-4-2-6 or 5-4-7-9, depends on actual structure.
    For this specific input `5 4 2 -1 6 -1 -1 7 -1 8 -1 9 -1 -1 10 -1 -1`, it means:
    Root 5
      Left 4
        Left 2
          Left -1
          Right 6
            Left -1
            Right -1
        Right 7
          Left -1
          Right 8
            Left -1
            Right 9
              Left -1
              Right -1
      Right 10
          Left -1
          Right -1
    This tree is skewed left. The longest path is 5-4-7-8-9 (5 nodes). So height would be 5.
    Output will vary based on exact input interpretation for `buildTree`.

3.  Input: 8 2 4 -1 -1 6 2 -1 -1 5 -1 -1 5 -1 9 -1 6 4 2 -1 -1 3 -1 -1 7 -1 -1
    This is a very long pre-order sequence. Its height would depend on the complex tree structure it forms.

### 1\. Binary Tree Node Structure

  * A `Node` in a Binary Tree typically consists of:
      * `data`: The value stored in the node.
      * `left`: A pointer to the left child node.
      * `right`: A pointer to the right child node.

### 2\. Height of a Binary Tree

  * **Definition**: The height of a binary tree is the **number of nodes** on the longest path from the root node to any leaf node.
      * An empty tree has a height of 0.
      * A tree with only a root node has a height of 1.

### 3\. Algorithm: `getHeight(Node* root)` (Recursive Approach)

  * **Core Idea**: The height of any node is `1` (for the node itself) plus the maximum height of its left or right subtrees.
  * **Recursive Steps**:
    1.  **Base Case**: If the `root` is `NULL` (meaning it's an empty subtree), its height is `0`.
    2.  **Recursive Calls**:
          * Recursively calculate the height of the `left` subtree.
          * Recursively calculate the height of the `right` subtree.
    3.  **Combine Results**: The height of the current `root` is `max(height_of_left_subtree, height_of_right_subtree) + 1`.

### 4\. Complexity Analysis

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`
      * The function visits each node in the tree exactly once to calculate its contribution to the height. `N` is the number of nodes in the tree.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(H)`
      * This is due to the recursion call stack. `H` is the height of the tree.
      * In the worst case (a skewed tree, resembling a linked list), `H` can be `N`, leading to `O(N)` space.
      * In the best case (a perfectly balanced tree), `H` is `log N`, leading to `O(log N)` space.
