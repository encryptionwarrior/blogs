```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> // Includes common standard libraries (like iostream)
#include "BinaryTree.h"  // Assumed to contain Node class and buildTree function definitions

using namespace std;     // Uses the standard namespace

// Function to check if two Binary Trees are identical
// Identical means same structure AND same data at corresponding nodes.
bool isIdentical(Node* root1, Node* root2) {
    // Base Case 1: If both nodes are NULL, they are identical at this point.
    if(root1 == NULL && root2 == NULL) {
        return true;
    }

    // Base Case 2: If one node is NULL and the other is not, they are NOT identical.
    if(root1 == NULL || root2 == NULL) { // Using || covers both root1!=NULL && root2==NULL AND root1==NULL && root2!=NULL
        return false;
    }

    // Recursive Step:
    // 1. Check if left subtrees are identical.
    bool isLeftIdentical = isIdentical(root1->left, root2->left);
    // 2. Check if right subtrees are identical.
    bool isRightIdentical = isIdentical(root1->right, root2->right);
    // 3. Check if data at current nodes is the same.
    bool areValuesSame = (root1->data == root2->data);

    // For the trees to be identical from this 'root1'/'root2' point downwards,
    // all three conditions must be true.
    return isLeftIdentical && isRightIdentical && areValuesSame;

int main() {
    Node* root1 = NULL; // Initialize root of Tree 1
    Node* root2 = NULL; // Initialize root of Tree 2

    cout << "\n--- Build Tree 2 ---" << endl;

    root2 = buildTree(root2);

Example INPUTs for buildTree function (enter twice, once for root1, once for root2):

1.  Input for Tree 1: 1 2 -1 -1 3 -1 -1

    Tree Structure for both:

### 1\. Binary Tree Node Structure

  * A `Node` in a Binary Tree typically consists of:
      * `data`: The value stored in the node.
      * `left`: A pointer to the left child node.
      * `right`: A pointer to the right child node.

### 2\. Identical Binary Trees

  * **Definition**: Two binary trees are considered identical if they have the **exact same structure** AND the **exact same data values** at all corresponding nodes.
  * This implies:
    1.  Both trees are empty (`NULL`), OR
    2.  Both trees are non-empty AND:
          * Their root nodes have the same data value.
          * Their left subtrees are identical.
          * Their right subtrees are identical.

### 3\. Algorithm: `isIdentical(Node* root1, Node* root2)` (Recursive Approach)

  * **Core Idea**: This function implements the definition of identical trees recursively by comparing nodes at corresponding positions.
  * **Recursive Steps**:
    1.  **Base Case 1 (Both NULL)**: If both `root1` and `root2` are `NULL`, it means we've reached the end of a branch in both trees simultaneously, and so far they are identical. Return `true`.
    2.  **Base Case 2 (One NULL, One Not)**: If one of `root1` or `root2` is `NULL` but the other is not, it means their structures don't match at this point. Return `false`.
    3.  **Recursive Calls**:
          * Recursively call `isIdentical` for the left children: `isLeft = isIdentical(root1->left, root2->left)`.
          * Recursively call `isIdentical` for the right children: `isRight = isIdentical(root1->right, root2->right)`.
          * Check if the data values at the current nodes are the same: `value = (root1->data == root2->data)`.
    4.  **Combine Results**: For the current nodes (`root1`, `root2`) to be part of identical trees, all three conditions must be `true`: the left subtrees must be identical (`isLeft`), the right subtrees must be identical (`isRight`), and their own data values must be equal (`value`). Return `isLeft && isRight && value`.

### 4\. Complexity Analysis

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(min(N1, N2))`
      * Where `N1` and `N2` are the number of nodes in `root1` and `root2` respectively.
      * The function traverses both trees simultaneously. It stops traversing a branch as soon as a mismatch is found or a `NULL` is hit in either tree. In the worst case (trees are identical or very similar), it visits each node in the smaller of the two trees.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(min(H1, H2))`
      * Due to the recursion call stack, where `H1` and `H2` are the heights of `root1` and `root2` respectively.
      * In the worst case (skewed tree), this could be `O(min(N1, N2))`. In the best case (balanced tree), `O(min(log N1, log N2))`.
