Example INPUTs for buildTree function (for reference):

1.  Input: 1 2 3 -1 -1 5 6 -1 -1 8 -1 -1 4 -1 7 -1 9 10 -1 -1 11 -1 -1
    Tree Structure:
                1
               / \
              2   4
             / \   \
            3   5   7
               / \   \
              6   8   9
                         \
                          10
                         /
                        11

    Expected Output:
    Root: 1
    Left Boundary (excluding leaves): 2
    Leaves (L-R): 3 6 8 10 11 (Note: 9 is not a leaf, 7 is not a leaf in this specific build)
    Right Boundary (excluding leaves, bottom-up): 7 4
    Combining: 1 2 3 6 8 10 11 7 4
    (The exact output for 9, 10, 11 depends on how buildTree handles input.
    Assuming the given input `1 2 3 -1 -1 5 6 -1 -1 8 -1 -1 4 -1 7 -1 9 10 -1 -1 11 -1 -1`
    creates:
            1
           / \
          2   4
         / \   \
        3   5   7
           / \   \
          6   8   9
                     \
                      10
                     /
                    11

    Output based on this code's logic:
    Root: 1
    Left boundary: 2 (3 is leaf, not added)
    Leaves: 3 (from left of 2), 6 (from left of 5), 8 (from right of 5), 11 (from left of 10)
    Right boundary: 7 (from right of 4), 9 (from right of 7), 10 (from right of 9)
    Result: 1 2 3 6 8 11 10 9 7 4 (Order of leaves from different subtrees, and right boundary reversed)
    Let's re-verify:
    traverseLeft(root->left=2): adds 2. Calls traverseLeft(3). 3 is leaf, returns. Calls traverseLeft(5).
      traverseLeft(5): adds 5. Calls traverseLeft(6). 6 is leaf, returns. Calls traverseLeft(8). 8 is leaf, returns.
    So left boundary part adds: 1, 2, 5 (if 5 is not a leaf itself). Oh wait, 5 has children 6 and 8.
    Let's draw `1 2 3 -1 -1 5 6 -1 -1 8 -1 -1 4 -1 7 -1 9 10 -1 -1 11 -1 -1`:
                  1
                /   \
               2     4
              / \     \
             3   5     7
                / \     \
               6   8     9
                          / \
                         10  -1
                        / \
                       11  -1

    Root: 1
    traverseLeft(2): adds 2. traverseLeft(3) (leaf -> skip). traverseLeft(5): adds 5. traverseLeft(6) (leaf -> skip). traverseLeft(8) (leaf -> skip).
      Left boundary result: [1, 2, 5]
    traverseLeaf(2): finds 3. adds 3.
    traverseLeaf(4): finds 6, 8, 11. adds 6, 8, 11.
      Leaves result: [3, 6, 8, 11]
    traverseRight(4): traverseRight(7): adds 7. traverseRight(9): adds 9. traverseRight(10): adds 10.
      Right boundary result (bottom-up): [10, 9, 7, 4] (added in reverse order of calls: 10 then 9 then 7 then 4)
    Combined: [1, 2, 5, 3, 6, 8, 11, 10, 9, 7, 4]
    This matches the provided code's logic.

2.  Input: 7 9 8 10 -1 -1 9 -1 -1 8 -1 -1 7 6 -1 -1 -1
    Tree Structure (from previous example, might be same if buildTree logic is consistent):
                7
               / \
              9   7
             / \   \
            8   9   6
           /   /
          10  8

    Root: 7
    Left Boundary: 9, 8 (10 is leaf -> skip)
    Leaves: 10, 9 (right of 9), 8 (right of 7), 6 (right of 7)
    Right Boundary: 7 (from right of root, 6 is leaf -> skip)
    Wait, the structure is:
                7
               / \
              9   7
             / \   \
            8   9   6
           / \
          10  -1
         / \
        -1 -1
    (Assuming previous example `7 9 8 10 -1 -1 9 -1 -1 8 -1 -1 7 6 -1 -1 -1` was:
    Root 7
      Left 9
        Left 8
          Left 10
            Left -1
            Right -1
          Right -1
        Right 9
          Left -1
          Right -1
      Right 7
        Left 6
          Left -1
          Right -1
        Right -1
    )
    Root: 7
    Left Boundary: 9, 8
    Leaves: 10, 9, 6
    Right Boundary: 7 (from right child of root) (in reverse, 6 is leaf so excluded from right boundary)
    Combined: 7 9 8 10 9 6 7

### 1\. Binary Tree Node Structure

  * A `Node` in a Binary Tree typically consists of:
      * `data`: The value stored in the node.
      * `left`: A pointer to the left child node.
      * `right`: A pointer to the right child node.

### 2\. Boundary Traversal Definition

  * Boundary Traversal of a Binary Tree involves traversing and printing nodes in the following order:

    1.  The **root node**.
    2.  All nodes on the **left boundary** (from root's left child down to the leftmost leaf, excluding any leaf nodes).
    3.  All **leaf nodes** (traversed from left to right).
    4.  All nodes on the **right boundary** (from the rightmost leaf up to the root's right child, excluding any leaf nodes), printed in reverse order (bottom-up).

  * **Important Note**: If the tree has only one node (the root is also a leaf), it should be printed only once. The strategy below handles this by excluding leaves from boundary traversals and collecting all leaves separately.

### 3\. Algorithm: `Boundary(Node* root)` and Helper Functions

The `Boundary` function orchestrates three helper functions: `traverseLeft`, `traverseLeaf`, and `traverseRight`.

#### a) `traverseLeft(Node* root, vector<int> &answer)`

  * **Purpose**: To collect nodes on the left boundary (top-down), excluding leaf nodes.
  * **Logic**:
      * **Base Case**: If `root` is `NULL`, return.
      * **Leaf Exclusion**: If `root` is a leaf node (both `left` and `right` are `NULL`), return without adding its data, as leaves are handled by `traverseLeaf`.
      * **Add Data**: Add `root->data` to the `answer` vector.
      * **Recursive Step**: Prioritize going left. If `root->left` exists, call `traverseLeft(root->left)`. Otherwise (if no left child), go right: `traverseLeft(root->right)`. This ensures a continuous path down the left edge.

#### b) `traverseLeaf(Node* root, vector<int> &answer)`

  * **Purpose**: To collect all leaf nodes in a left-to-right order.
  * **Logic**:
      * **Base Case**: If `root` is `NULL`, return.
      * **Leaf Identification**: If `root` is a leaf node, add its `data` to the `answer` vector.
      * **Recursive Step**: Recursively call `traverseLeaf` for `root->left` then `root->right`. This ensures leaves are processed in left-to-right order.

#### c) `traverseRight(Node* root, vector<int> &answer)`

  * **Purpose**: To collect nodes on the right boundary (bottom-up), excluding leaf nodes.
  * **Logic**:
      * **Base Case**: If `root` is `NULL`, return.
      * **Leaf Exclusion**: If `root` is a leaf node, return.
      * **Recursive Step**: Prioritize going right. If `root->right` exists, call `traverseRight(root->right)`. Otherwise (if no right child), go left: `traverseRight(root->left)`.
      * **Add Data (Post-order like)**: Add `root->data` to the `answer` vector *after* the recursive calls. This ensures nodes are added in bottom-up order, achieving the "reverse" traversal for the right boundary.

#### d) `Boundary(Node* root)` Main Function

  * **Initialization**: Create an empty `answer` vector. If `root` is `NULL`, return it.
  * **Root Node**: Add `root->data` to `answer`.
  * **Left Boundary**: Call `traverseLeft(root->left, answer)`.
  * **Leaf Nodes**: Call `traverseLeaf(root->left, answer)` to collect leaves from the left subtree, then `traverseLeaf(root->right, answer)` for leaves from the right subtree. This ensures all leaves are collected in left-to-right order.
  * **Right Boundary**: Call `traverseRight(root->right, answer)`.
  * **Return**: Return the `answer` vector.

### 4\. Complexity Analysis

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`
      * Each node in the tree is visited at most a constant number of times across the three helper functions. For example, a node might be visited by `traverseLeft` or `traverseRight` (if it's on a boundary), and by `traverseLeaf` (if it's a leaf), and `traverseLeft` and `traverseRight` are careful not to double count leaves.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(H)`
      * Due to the recursion call stack for the helper functions, where `H` is the height of the tree.
      * The `answer` vector stores `O(N)` elements in the worst case (e.g., a tree where almost all nodes are on the boundary).
