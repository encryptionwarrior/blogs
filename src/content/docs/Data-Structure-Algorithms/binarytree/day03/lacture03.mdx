```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> // Includes common standard libraries (iostream, queue, vector, map, utility for pair)
#include "BinaryTree.h"  // Assumed to contain Node class and buildTree function definitions

using namespace std;     // Uses the standard namespace

// Function to perform Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree
// Nodes are printed column by column, from top to bottom within each column.
vector<int> VerticalOrder(Node* root) {
    // Base Case: If the tree is empty, return an empty vector.
    if(root == NULL) {
        return {};
    }

    vector<int> answer; // Final vector to store the vertical order traversal result

    // map<Horizontal_Distance, map<Level, vector<Node_Data>>>
    // NodeMap stores nodes grouped by HD, then by Level, then collects data.
    // std::map automatically keeps keys (HDs and Levels) sorted.
    map<int, map<int, vector<int>>> NodeMap;

    // Queue for BFS traversal: stores {Node*, {Horizontal_Distance, Level}}
    queue<pair<Node*, pair<int, int>>> Q;

    // Start BFS: push root with HD=0 and Level=0
    Q.push(make_pair(root, make_pair(0,0)));

    // Perform BFS traversal
    while(!Q.empty()) {
        // Get the front element from the queue
        pair<Node*, pair<int, int>> temp = Q.front();
        Q.pop(); // Remove it from the queue

        // Extract node, horizontal distance (HD), and level
        Node* FrontNode = temp.first;
        int HorizDist = temp.second.first;
        int Lvl = temp.second.second;

        // Store the node's data in the NodeMap based on its HD and Level

        // hd_entry.first is the HD, hd_entry.second is the inner map<Level, vector<int>>
        for(auto const& level_entry : hd_entry.second) { // Iterate through each Level within this HD
            // level_entry.first is the Level, level_entry.second is the vector<int> of node data
            for(int node_data : level_entry.second) { // Iterate through node data at this HD and Level
                answer.push_back(node_data); // Add to final answer

Example INPUTs for buildTree function (for reference):

1.  Input: 1 2 3 -1 -1 5 6 -1 -1 8 -1 -1 4 -1 7 -1 9 10 -1 -1 11 -1 -1
    (Assuming this input generates the tree as discussed in previous responses, e.g., the complex one)
    Tree Structure example:
                  1 (0,0)
                /   \
               2(-1,1) 4(1,1)
              / \     \
             3(-2,2) 5(0,2)  7(2,2)
                    / \     \
                   6(-1,3) 8(1,3)  9(3,3)
                                  /
                                 10(2,4)
                                /
                               11(1,5)

    HD: -2 -> 3
    HD: -1 -> 2, 6
    HD: 0  -> 1, 5
    HD: 1  -> 4, 8, 11
    HD: 2  -> 7, 10
    HD: 3  -> 9

    Output: Vertical Order Traversal : 3 2 6 1 5 4 8 11 7 10 9
    (The exact order might slightly vary based on how nodes on same HD & Level are added, but map handles levels.
    The crucial bit is that nodes with same HD and same LEVEL are added to the vector in order of their BFS discovery)

2.  Input: 1 2 4 -1 -1 5 -1 -1 3 6 -1 8 -1 -1 7 -1 9 -1 -1
    Tree Structure:
                1 (0,0)
               / \
              2(-1,1) 3(1,1)
             / \     / \
            4(-2,2) 5(0,2) 6(0,2) 7(2,2)
                          / \     / \
                         8(-1,3)   9(1,3)

    HD: -2 -> 4
    HD: -1 -> 2, 8
    HD: 0  -> 1, 5, 6
    HD: 1  -> 3, 9
    HD: 2  -> 7

    Output: Vertical Order Traversal : 4 2 8 1 5 6 3 9 7
    (Here, for HD=0 and Level=2, 5 comes before 6 as it's processed first in BFS).

### 1\. Binary Tree Node Structure

  * A `Node` in a Binary Tree typically consists of:
      * `data`: The value stored in the node.
      * `left`: A pointer to the left child node.
      * `right`: A pointer to the right child node.

### 2\. Vertical Order Traversal Definition

  * **Definition**: Nodes are traversed and collected column by column based on their horizontal distance from the root.
      * All nodes at the same horizontal distance belong to the same "vertical line".
      * Within each vertical line, nodes are typically traversed from top to bottom (i.e., by increasing level).
      * If multiple nodes fall on the same horizontal distance AND the same level (which is rare in standard binary trees, but possible), their relative order (e.g., left-to-right as in level order) is usually preserved.

### 3\. Horizontal Distance (HD) and Level Convention

  * **Root Node**: Assigned a Horizontal Distance (HD) of `0` and Level `0`.
  * **Left Child**: For a node at `(HD, Level)`, its left child will be at `(HD - 1, Level + 1)`.
  * **Right Child**: For a node at `(HD, Level)`, its right child will be at `(HD + 1, Level + 1)`.

### 4\. Algorithm: `VerticalOrder(Node* root)`

  * **Core Idea**: Uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the tree. While traversing, it keeps track of each node's horizontal distance (HD) and its level. A `map` of `map` (or `map` of `vector` where custom sorting might be needed for levels) is used to store nodes, which naturally sorts them by HD and then by Level.

  * **Data Structures Used**:

      * `queue<pair<Node*, pair<int, int>>> Q`: This queue is used for the BFS. Each element in the queue is a `pair` containing:
          * `Node*`: The current tree node.
          * `pair<int, int>`: Another pair representing `{HorizontalDistance, Level}` of that node.
      * `map<int, map<int, vector<int>>> NodeMap`: This nested map is crucial for storing and sorting nodes:
          * **Outer Map Key (`int` HD)**: Stores nodes grouped by their horizontal distance. `std::map` inherently sorts keys, ensuring vertical lines are processed from left to right (smallest HD to largest HD).
          * **Inner Map Key (`int` Level)**: Stores nodes within a specific horizontal distance, grouped by their level. `std::map` inherently sorts keys, ensuring nodes within a vertical line are processed from top to bottom (smallest Level to largest Level).
          * **Innermost Value (`vector<int>`)**: Stores the `data` of nodes. A `vector` is used to handle cases where multiple nodes might fall on the exact same HD and Level (though less common in a strict binary tree).

  * **Steps**:

    1.  **Handle Empty Tree**: If `root` is `NULL`, return an empty vector.
    2.  **Initialization**:
          * Push the `root` node into the queue `Q`, along with its initial HD `0` and Level `0`: `Q.push({root, {0, 0}});`.
    3.  **BFS Traversal (`while(!Q.empty())`)**:
          * Dequeue the `temp` element from the front of the `Q`.
          * Extract `FrontNode` (the actual tree node), `HorizDist`, and `Lvl` from `temp`.
          * **Store in `NodeMap`**: Add `FrontNode->data` to the `vector` associated with its `HorizDist` and `Lvl` in `NodeMap`: `NodeMap[HorizDist][Lvl].push_back(FrontNode->data);`.
          * **Enqueue Children**:
              * If `FrontNode->left` exists: Enqueue it with `HD-1` and `Lvl+1`.
              * If `FrontNode->right` exists: Enqueue it with `HD+1` and `Lvl+1`.
    4.  **Construct Final Result**: After the BFS loop completes, `NodeMap` holds all nodes correctly grouped and sorted.
          * Iterate through `NodeMap` (outer map for HDs).
          * For each HD, iterate through its inner map (for Levels).
          * For each Level, iterate through the `vector` of node data.
          * Add each node's `data` to the `answer` vector.
    5.  **Return**: Return the `answer` vector containing all node data in vertical order.

### 5\. Complexity Analysis

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N log W + N log H)` or effectively `O(N log N)` in worst case.

      * `N`: Number of nodes in the tree.
      * `W`: Width of the tree (number of distinct horizontal distances).
      * `H`: Height of the tree (number of distinct levels).
      * BFS traversal itself is `O(N)`.
      * Inserting into `std::map` takes `O(log K)` time, where `K` is the number of elements already in the map.
          * The outer map has `W` entries.
          * The inner maps have up to `H` entries.
          * Thus, insertions dominate: `N` insertions into `NodeMap` which involves `log W` for outer map and `log H` for inner map lookup/insertion on average.
      * Iterating through the map at the end is `O(N)` because it visits each stored node once.
      * Overall, `O(N log W)` if levels within a column are just appended to vector and not sorted, but with `map<int, map<int, vector<int>>>` it's `O(N log W + N log H)`. Since `W` and `H` can be `O(N)` in worst-case (skewed tree), it can be `O(N log N)`.

  * **Space Complexity**: `O(N)`

      * `Q` (queue) can store up to `O(W)` nodes.
      * `NodeMap` stores all `N` nodes. In the worst case (a skewed tree), `NodeMap` might have `N` distinct horizontal distances, each containing one node.
      * `answer` vector stores `O(N)` elements.
      * Therefore, the space complexity is dominated by storing all nodes in `NodeMap` and `answer`, leading to `O(N)`.
