```cpp

#include "BinaryTree.h"  // Assumed to contain Node class and buildTree function definitions

using namespace std;     // Uses the standard namespace

// Function to find the Right View of a Binary Tree using recursion.
// This function performs a modified traversal prioritizing the right child first (Root -> Right -> Left).
// Parameters:
//   root: The current node being processed.
//   answer: A reference to the vector that will store the Right View nodes.
//   lvl: The current level of the 'root' node (root of the whole tree is level 0).
void RightView(Node* root, vector<int>& answer, int lvl) {
    // Base Case: If the current node is NULL, stop the recursion for this path.
    if(root == NULL) {
        return;
    }

    // Check if this is the first time we are visiting a node at the current 'lvl'.
    // 'answer.size()' tells us how many levels have already had their rightmost node recorded.
    // If 'lvl' matches 'answer.size()', it means we are at a NEW level for which we
    // haven't added a rightmost node yet. Since we prioritize right traversal,
    // this node MUST be the rightmost for this level.
    if(lvl == answer.size()) {
        answer.push_back(root->data); // Add the node's data to the Right View list.
    }

    // Recursively call for the right child FIRST.
    // This is the critical difference from Left View and ensures that the
    // rightmost path is explored before the left, correctly identifying
    // the rightmost node for each level.
    RightView(root->right, answer, lvl + 1);

    // Recursively call for the left child.
    // Nodes from the left subtree will only be added if their level
    // was not already covered by a node in the right subtree (i.e., if the right subtree
    // was shorter or non-existent for a particular level).
    RightView(root->left, answer, lvl + 1);
}

int main() {
    Node* root = NULL; // Initialize the root of the tree to NULL

    // Build the tree using 'buildTree' function (assumed to be in "BinaryTree.h")
    // It typically takes input in a pre-order fashion.
    root = buildTree(root);

    vector<int> answer; // Vector to store the Right View nodes
    // Start the recursive RightView traversal from the root at level 0.
    RightView(root, answer, 0);

    // Print the Right View result
    cout << endl << "Right View : ";
    for(int data : answer) {
        cout << data << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0; // End of the program

### 1\. Binary Tree Node Structure

  * A `Node` in a Binary Tree typically consists of:
      * `data`: The value stored in the node.
      * `left`: A pointer to the left child node.
      * `right`: A pointer to the right child node.

### 2\. Right View of a Binary Tree Definition

  * **Definition**: The Right View of a Binary Tree is the set of nodes visible when looking at the tree from the right side.
  * **Key Property**: For each level of the tree, the **rightmost node** at that level is part of the Right View.

### 3\. Algorithm: `RightView(Node* root, vector<int>& answer, int lvl)` (Recursive Approach)

  * **Core Idea**: This is a modified traversal (similar to Pre-order, but prioritizing the right child first: Root -\> Right -\> Left). We maintain a `level` parameter and a result `vector`. For each new `level` encountered, the first node visited will be the rightmost node for that level.

  * **Parameters**:

      * `Node* root`: The current node being processed.
      * `vector<int>& answer`: A reference to the vector where the Right View nodes will be stored. This vector dynamically grows as new levels are discovered.
      * `int lvl`: The current level of the `root` node. The root of the entire tree is typically `lvl = 0`.

  * **Steps**:

    1.  **Base Case**: If `root` is `NULL`, simply return (nothing to add).
    2.  **Check for New Level's First Node**:
          * `if(lvl == answer.size())`: This is the crucial condition, identical to Left View.
              * `answer.size()` indicates how many levels we've already found a rightmost node for.
              * If the current `lvl` is equal to `answer.size()`, it means we are at a level for which we *haven't yet added any node* to our `answer` list.
              * Because we prioritize the **right child first** in our recursive calls, the first node we encounter at any new level will guarantee it's the rightmost node for that level.
              * If this condition is true, `answer.push_back(root->data);` adds this node's data to our result.
    3.  **Recursive Calls**:
          * `RightView(root->right, answer, lvl + 1);`: **Crucially, recursively call for the right child FIRST.** This ensures that the rightmost path is explored before the left, allowing us to find the rightmost node for each level.
          * `RightView(root->left, answer, lvl + 1);`: Recursively call for the left child. Nodes from the left subtree will only be added if their level was not already covered by a node in the right subtree (i.e., if the right subtree ended before a certain level, or didn't exist).

### 4\. Complexity Analysis

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`
      * Each node in the tree is visited exactly once during the recursion.
  * **Space Complexity**: `O(H)`
      * Due to the recursion call stack, where `H` is the height of the tree.
      * In the worst case (a skewed tree), `H` can be `N`, leading to `O(N)` space.
      * In the best case (a balanced tree), `H` is `log N`, leading to `O(log N)` space.
      * The `answer` vector also uses `O(H)` space as it stores one node per level.
