    // Queue for BFS traversal: stores {Node*, Horizontal_Distance}
    queue<pair<Node*, int>> Q;

    // Start BFS: push root with HD=0
    Q.push(make_pair(root, 0));

    // Perform BFS traversal
    while(!Q.empty()) {
        // Get the front element from the queue

        Q.pop(); // Remove it from the queue

        // Extract node and its horizontal distance (HD)
        Node* FrontNode = temp.first;
        int HorizDist = temp.second;

        // If this Horizontal Distance has NOT been encountered yet,
        // it means this is the TOPMOST node for this HD. Store its data.
        if(TopNode.find(HorizDist) == TopNode.end()) {
            TopNode[HorizDist] = FrontNode->data;
        }

        // Enqueue left child if it exists: HD decreases by 1

        }

        // Enqueue right child if it exists: HD increases by 1
        if(FrontNode->right) {
            Q.push(make_pair(FrontNode->right, HorizDist + 1));
        }
    }

    // After BFS, TopNode map contains all nodes visible from the top, sorted by HD.
    // Iterate through the map to populate the final answer vector.
    for(auto const& entry : TopNode) { // 'entry' is a pair<HD, Node_Data>
        answer.push_back(entry.second); // Add the node's data (value part of the map entry)
    }

    return answer; // Return the complete Top View traversal
}


int main() {
    Node* root = NULL; // Initialize the root of the tree to NULL

    // Build the tree using 'buildTree' function (assumed to be in "BinaryTree.h")
    // It typically takes input in a pre-order fashion.
    root = buildTree(root);

    // Perform Top View Traversal using the correct BFS-based approach (TopView2)
    vector<int> result = TopView2(root);

    // Print the Top View Traversal result
    cout << endl << "Top View : ";
    for(int data : result) {
        cout << data << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

### 1\. Binary Tree Node Structure

  * A `Node` in a Binary Tree typically consists of:
      * `data`: The value stored in the node.
      * `left`: A pointer to the left child node.
      * `right`: A pointer to the right child node.

### 2\. Top View of a Binary Tree Definition

  * **Definition**: The Top View of a Binary Tree is the set of nodes visible when looking at the tree from directly above.
  * **Key Property**: For any given **horizontal distance (column)**, only the **highest node** (the node with the smallest level) at that distance is part of the Top View.
  * **Horizontal Distance (HD) Convention**:
      * **Root Node**: Assigned a Horizontal Distance (HD) of `0`.
      * **Left Child**: For a node at `HD`, its left child will be at `HD - 1`.
      * **Right Child**: For a node at `HD`, its right child will be at `HD + 1`.

### 3\. Algorithm: `TopView2(Node* root)` (Correct BFS Approach)

  * **Core Idea**: Uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the tree level by level. A `map` is used to store the first node encountered for each horizontal distance. Since BFS explores nodes top-down (level by level), the first node encountered for a particular HD will always be the highest node in that vertical column, ensuring it's part of the Top View.

  * **Data Structures Used**:

      * `queue<pair<Node*, int>> Q`: This queue is used for the BFS. Each element is a `pair` containing:
          * `Node*`: The current tree node.
          * `int`: The `HorizontalDistance` (HD) of that node. (Level is implicitly handled by BFS's level-by-level traversal).
      * `map<int, int> TopNode`: This map is crucial for storing the Top View nodes:
          * **Key (`int` HD)**: Represents the horizontal distance. `std::map` inherently sorts keys, ensuring the output is ordered from left to right (smallest HD to largest HD).
          * **Value (`int` node data)**: Stores the `data` of the node that is visible from the top at that specific `HD`.

  * **Steps**:

    1.  **Handle Empty Tree**: If `root` is `NULL`, return an empty vector.
    2.  **Initialization**:
          * Push the `root` node into the queue `Q`, along with its initial HD `0`: `Q.push({root, 0});`.
    3.  **BFS Traversal (`while(!Q.empty())`)**:
          * Dequeue the `temp` element from the front of the `Q`.
          * Extract `FrontNode` (the actual tree node) and its `HorizDist`.
          * **Record Top Node for HD**:
              * `if(TopNode.find(HorizDist) == TopNode.end())`: This condition checks if an entry for `HorizDist` already exists in `TopNode`.
              * If it **does not exist** (i.e., this is the *first* node encountered at this `HorizDist`): `TopNode[HorizDist] = FrontNode->data;` - store its data.
              * If it **already exists**: Do nothing. This ensures that only the highest node (first encountered in BFS) for that HD is kept.
          * **Enqueue Children**:
              * If `FrontNode->left` exists: Enqueue it with `HD-1`.
              * If `FrontNode->right` exists: Enqueue it with `HD+1`.
    4.  **Construct Final Result**: After the BFS loop completes, `TopNode` contains the data of all visible nodes, sorted by their horizontal distance.
          * Iterate through `TopNode` (which iterates by sorted HDs).
          * For each `pair<HD, data>` in `TopNode`, add `data` to the `answer` vector.
    5.  **Return**: Return the `answer` vector containing the Top View nodes.

### 4\. Complexity Analysis for `TopView2`

  * **Time Complexity**: `O(N log W)`

      * `N`: Number of nodes in the tree.
      * `W`: Width of the tree (number of distinct horizontal distances).
      * BFS traversal itself is `O(N)`.
      * Inserting into `std::map` takes `O(log K)` time, where `K` is the number of elements already in the map. Here, the map will have at most `W` distinct horizontal distances. So, `N` insertions and lookups contribute `O(N log W)`.
      * Iterating through the map at the end is `O(W)`.
      * Overall, `O(N log W)`. In the worst case (a skewed tree), `W` can be `O(N)`, leading to `O(N log N)`.

  * **Space Complexity**: `O(N)`

      * `Q` (queue) can store up to `O(W)` nodes.
      * `TopNode` (map) stores up to `O(W)` entries, each containing a node's data.
      * `answer` vector stores `O(W)` elements.
      * Therefore, the space complexity is dominated by these structures, leading to `O(W)`. Since `W` can be `O(N)` (e.g., a perfect binary tree has `W = N/2 + 1`), the space is `O(N)` in the worst case.

### **Note on `TopView` (Recursive Approach)**

The `TopView` function implemented using `traverseLeft` and `traverseRight` helper functions is **not generally correct** for all binary tree structures. It works for some specific tree shapes (like perfectly balanced or strictly skewed trees), but it fails to correctly identify the highest node for a given horizontal distance when a lower-level node is visible due to an open path, but an earlier traversed parent node (which is not directly above) might block it, or when a node is hidden by another node at the same HD but a higher level in a non-trivial configuration. The BFS-based `TopView2` approach is robust and generally accepted for this problem.
