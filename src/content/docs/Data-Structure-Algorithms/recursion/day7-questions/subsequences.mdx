title: Sub Sequences

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Helper function to generate subsequences
void solve(vector<string>& ans, string str, string output, int i) {
    // Base case: if we've processed all characters in the input string
    if (i >= str.length()) {
        // If the current output (subsequence) is non-empty, add it to ans
        if (output.length() > 0)
            ans.push_back(output);
        return;
    }

    // Recursive call to exclude the current character
    solve(ans, str, output, i + 1);
    
    // Recursive call to include the current character
    output.push_back(str[i]);
    solve(ans, str, output, i + 1);
}

// Main function to initiate the recursive process
vector<string> subsequences(string str) {
    vector<string> ans;      // Store all subsequences
    string output = "";      // Track the current subsequence being formed
    solve(ans, str, output, 0);  // Start the recursion from index 0
    return ans;
}
```

#### Example:
1. Initial Call: `subsequences("abc")` calls solve with `output = ""` and `i = 0`.
2. First Character (`'a'`):
    - Exclude `'a'`: Call `solve(ans, "abc", "", 1);`
    - Include `'a'`: Call `solve(ans, "abc", "a", 1);`
3. Second Character (`'b'`):
    - For each of the above calls, we make two more calls:
        - Exclude `'b'`: Calls `solve(ans, "abc", "", 2);` and `solve(ans, "abc", "a", 2);`
        - Include `'b'`: Calls `solve(ans, "abc", "b", 2)`; and `solve(ans, "abc", "ab", 2);`
4. Third Character (`'c'`):
    - The pattern continues, with each call branching into two more calls, either excluding or including `'c'`.
5. Base Case Reached:
    - When `i == 3` (end of the string), `output` is added to `ans` if it's non-empty.

##### Generated Subsequences
```c++
["a", "ab", "abc", "ac", "b", "bc", "c"]
```
