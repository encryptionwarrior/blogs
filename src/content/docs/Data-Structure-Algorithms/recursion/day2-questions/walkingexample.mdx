```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void reachHome(int src, int dest) {
    // Display current position (source) and the target position (destination)
    cout << "source: " << src << " destination: " << dest << endl;

    // Base case: if the source (current position) is equal to the destination
    if(src == dest) {
        cout << "Pahuch gya (Reached home)" << endl;
        return;
    }

    // Processing: Move one step forward (increment the source)
    src++;

    // Recursive call: Call the function again with the updated source
    reachHome(src, dest);
}
```

##### Example Walkthrough:
starting position is src = 1 and the destination is dest = 5. We call the function reachHome(1, 5):

1. First Call (`src = 1, dest = 5`):
    - The current position is 1, and the destination is 5. Since `src` is not equal to `dest`, the function increments `src` by 1 and recursively calls `reachHome(2, 5)`.
1. Second Call (`src = 2, dest = 5`):
    - The current position is 2. It increments `src` by 1 and recursively calls `reachHome(3, 5)`.
1. Third Call (`src = 3, dest = 5`):
    - The current position is 3. It increments `src` by 1 and recursively calls `reachHome(4, 5)`.
1. Fourth Call (`src = 4, dest = 5`):
    - The current position is 4. It increments `src` by 1 and recursively calls `reachHome(5, 5)`.
1. Fifth Call (`src = 5, dest = 5`):
    - Now, src equals dest, so the base case is triggered, and the function prints `"Pahuch gya (Reached home)"` and stops the recursion.
