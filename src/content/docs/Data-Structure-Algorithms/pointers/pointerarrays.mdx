title: Pointer Arrays
description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

- Arrays and pointers are closely related. An array name acts as a pointer to the first element of the array.
- You can use pointers to access and manipulate array elements.
```c++
int arr[] = {10, 20, 30};
int *ptr = arr;  // Pointer points to the first element of the array

cout << ptr[1];  // Outputs 20
cout << *(ptr + 2);  // Outputs 30 (pointer arithmetic)
```

- `arr` is the same as `&arr[0]` (address of the first element).
- Incrementing a pointer (`ptr++`) moves to the next element in the array.

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int *ptr = arr;  // Pointer to first element
    
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << "Element " << i << ": " << *(ptr + i) << endl;  // Accessing array elements via pointer
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Other Examples:
```c++
int arr[10] = {23, 122, 41, 67};

 cout <<" address of first memory block is " << arr << endl;
    cout << arr[0] << endl;
    cout <<" address of first memory block is " << &arr[0] << endl;

    cout << "4th " << *arr << endl;
    cout << "5th " << *arr + 1 << endl;
    cout << "6th " << *(arr + 1) << endl;
    cout << "7th " << *(arr) + 1 << endl;
    cout << "8th " << arr[2] << endl;
    cout << "9th " << *(arr+2) << endl;

    int i = 3;
    cout << i[arr] << endl;

   int temp[10] = {1,2};
   cout << sizeof(temp) << endl;
   cout << " 1st " <<  sizeof(*temp) << endl;
   cout << " 2nd " <<  sizeof(&temp) << endl;

   int *ptr = &temp[0];
   cout << sizeof(ptr) << endl ;
   cout << sizeof(*ptr) << endl ;
   cout << sizeof(&ptr) << endl ;

   int a[20] = {1,2,3,5};

    cout << " ->" << &a[0] << endl;
  cout << &a << endl;
    cout << a << endl;

   int *p = &a[0];
   cout << p << endl;
   cout << *p << endl;
   cout << "-> " << &p << endl;

    int arr[10];

//ERROR
   arr = arr+1;

    int *ptr = &arr[0];
    cout << ptr << endl;
    ptr = ptr + 1;
    cout << ptr << endl;

```
