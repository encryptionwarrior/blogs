Pointers provide the ability to work directly with memory by storing and manipulating the addresses of variables

### Pointer Basics:
- A pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable.
- The type of the pointer is associated with the type of variable it points to.
###### Syntax:
```c++
int *ptr;  // Declares a pointer to an integer
```
###### Examples:
```c++
int a = 5;
int *ptr = &a;  // `ptr` stores the address of `a`
```

### Dereferencing a Pointer:
- To access the value stored at the address a pointer points to, you use the dereferencing operator `*`.
- Dereferencing allows you to read or modify the value of the variable pointed to by the pointer.
```c++
int a = 5;
int *ptr = &a;  // Pointer `ptr` holds the address of `a`
int value = *ptr;  // Dereferencing `ptr` gives the value of `a`, which is 5
```

### Address-of Operator (&):
- The address-of operator (&) is used to get the memory address of a variable.
```c++
int a = 5;
int *ptr = &a;  // `ptr` stores the address of `a`
```

### Pointer Arithmetic:
- Pointers can be incremented (`ptr++`), decremented (`ptr--`), and used in arithmetic operations.
- When incrementing a pointer, it moves by the size of the type it points to (e.g., for an `int` pointer, it moves by `sizeof(int)`).
```c++
int arr[] = {10, 20, 30};
int *ptr = arr;  // Pointer to the first element
ptr++;  // Moves to the next element in the array (ptr now points to `arr[1]`)
```

### Null Pointer:
- A pointer that does not point to any memory location is called a null pointer.
- It is initialized with the value NULL or nullptr in C++.
```c++
int *ptr = NULL;  // Pointer is not pointing to any valid memory location
```

### Pointer to Pointer (Double Pointer):
- A pointer can store the address of another pointer, creating a pointer to pointer.
```c++
int a = 10;
int *p1 = &a;  // `p1` is a pointer to `a`
int **p2 = &p1;  // `p2` is a pointer to `p1`
```

### Dynamic Memory Allocation:
- Memory can be dynamically allocated at runtime using pointers.
- In C++, this is done using `new` and `delete`.
- In C, this is done using `malloc()` and `free()`.
```c++
int *arr = new int[5];  // Allocates an array of 5 integers
delete[] arr;  // Frees the allocated memory
```

### Void Pointer:
- A void pointer (`void *`) is a generic pointer that can point to any data type.
- To dereference a void pointer, it must first be cast to the appropriate data type.
```c++
void *ptr;
int a = 10;
ptr = &a;  // Void pointer can point to any type
int *intPtr = (int*)ptr;  // Cast it back to an int pointer before dereferencing
```

### Summary of Key Pointer Operations:
| Operation                  | Explanation                                        | Example                |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Declare a pointer           | Stores the address of a variable                   | `int *ptr;`            |
| Assign address to pointer   | Use `&` to assign the address of a variable        | `ptr = &var;`          |
| Dereference a pointer       | Access the value stored at the memory location     | `*ptr`                 |
| Null pointer                | Pointer with no valid address                      | `ptr = NULL;`          |
| Pointer to pointer          | A pointer storing the address of another pointer   | `int **pptr = &ptr;`   |
| Pointer arithmetic          | Increment or decrement pointer address             | `ptr++`                |
| Dynamic memory allocation   | Allocates memory dynamically                       | `int *p = new int[10];`|
| Free allocated memory       | Deallocate memory allocated by `new` or `malloc()` | `delete[] p;`          |


### Example Program:
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int *ptr = &a;    // Pointer stores the address of `a`
    cout << "Address of a: " << ptr << endl;  // Output the address
    cout << "Value of a: " << *ptr << endl;   // Dereferencing to get the value of `a`
    *ptr = 20;  // Changing the value at the memory address
    cout << "New value of a: " << a << endl;  // Output the updated value of `a`
    return 0;
}
```

### Important:
- **Dangling Pointer**: A pointer pointing to a memory location that has been deallocated.
- **Memory Leaks**: Occur when dynamically allocated memory is not freed.

### Other Examples:
```c++
  //pointer to int is created, and pointing to some garbage address
    int *p = 0; 
    cout << *p << endl;
    int i = 5;
    int *q = &i;
    cout << q << endl;
    cout << *q << endl;
    int *p = 0;
    p = &i;
    cout << p << endl;
    cout << *p << endl;
```
```c++
  //pointer to int is created, and pointing to some garbage address
    int *p = 0; 
    cout << *p << endl;
    int i = 5;
    int *q = &i;
    cout << q << endl;
    cout << *q << endl;
    int *p = 0;
    p = &i;
    cout << p << endl;
    cout << *p << endl;

    int num = 5;
   int a = num;
   cout << "a before " << num << endl;
   a++;
   cout << "a after " << num << endl;


   int *p  = &num;
   cout << "before " << num << endl;
   (*p)++;
   cout << "after " << num << endl;

    //copying a pointer
   int *q = p;
   cout << p <<" - " << q << endl;
   cout << *p <<" - " << *q << endl;

   //important concept
   int i = 3;
   int *t = &i;
   //cout <<  (*t)++ << endl;
   *t = *t +1;
    cout << *t << endl;
    cout << " before t " << t << endl;
    t = t + 1;
    cout << " after t " << t << endl;
```

```c++
 int num  = 5 ;
    cout << num << endl;
    // address of Operator - &
    cout <<" address of num is " << &num << endl;
    int *ptr = &num;
    cout << "Address is : " << ptr << endl;
    cout << "value is : " << *ptr << endl;

    double d = 4.3;
    double *p2 = &d;

    cout << "Address is : " << p2 << endl;
    cout << "value is : " << *p2 << endl;

    cout << " size of integer is " << sizeof(num) << endl;
    cout << " size of pointer is " << sizeof(ptr) << endl;
    cout << " size of pointer is " << sizeof(p2) << endl;
```
