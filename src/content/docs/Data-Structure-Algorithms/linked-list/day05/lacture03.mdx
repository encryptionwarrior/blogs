-----

A **circular linked list** is a variation of a linked list where the `next` pointer of the last node points back to the first node (head) of the list, instead of being `NULL`. This forms a cycle.

**Key Characteristics:**

  * **No `NULL` pointer:** Unlike singly or doubly linked lists, there is no `NULL` pointer to indicate the end of the list. The traversal continues until you reach the starting node again.
  * **Traversal:** To traverse a circular linked list, you typically start from a known node (e.g., the head or the node after the tail) and continue until you return to the starting node. A `do-while` loop is often suitable for this.
  * **Entry Point:** While you can use a `head` pointer, it's often more convenient to maintain a `tail` pointer. From the `tail`, you can easily access the `head` (as `tail->next`) and also quickly insert at the end.

**Advantages:**

  * **Continuous Looping:** Useful for applications that require continuous cycling through elements, like a round-robin scheduling algorithm or a playlist that repeats.
  * **Easy Access to Head and Tail:** With a `tail` pointer, both the `head` (`tail->next`) and `tail` are directly accessible in $O(1)$ time.
  * **Efficient Insertions/Deletions:** Similar to other linked lists, insertion and deletion are efficient as they only require pointer manipulations.

**Disadvantages:**

  * **Infinite Loop Risk:** If not handled carefully, traversal can lead to infinite loops if the termination condition (returning to the start node) is not correctly implemented.
  * **More Complex Operations:** Some operations, like splitting or reversing, can be slightly more complex due to the circular nature.

-----

**Example:**

Consider a circular linked list representing `A -> B -> C` where `C` points back to `A`.

  * If `tail` points to `C`:
      * `tail->data` is `C`.
      * `tail->next` points to `A` (the head).

**Insertion (e.g., insert `X` after `B`):**

Original List: `A -> B -> C -> (points to A)`

1.  Find the node `B`.
2.  Create a new node `X`.
3.  Set `X->next` to what `B->next` was (which is `C`).
4.  Set `B->next` to `X`.

Result: `A -> B -> X -> C -> (points to A)`

**Deletion (e.g., delete `B`):**

Original List: `A -> B -> X -> C -> (points to A)`

1.  Find the node *before* `B`, which is `A`. Let's call it `prev`.
2.  Let `curr` be `B`.
3.  Set `prev->next` (which is `A->next`) to `curr->next` (which is `X`).
4.  Delete `curr` (node `B`).

Result: `A -> X -> C -> (points to A)`

The `splitList` function in the provided code demonstrates how a single circular linked list can be divided into two separate circular linked lists, which is a more complex operation than simple insertion/deletion, requiring careful handling of pointers to maintain the circular property of both new lists.
