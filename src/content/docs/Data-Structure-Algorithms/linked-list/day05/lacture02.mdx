### Removing Duplicates from a Singly Linked List

Removing duplicates from a **singly linked list** involves identifying and deleting nodes that contain values already present earlier in the list. There are primarily two common approaches, each with different time complexities:

1.  **Using Nested Loops (Brute Force):**

      * This method involves two pointers: an outer pointer (`curr`) that iterates through each node, and an inner pointer (`temp`) that starts from `curr`'s next and checks for duplicates.
      * For each node pointed to by `curr`, the inner loop traverses the rest of the list. If `temp` finds a node with the same data as `curr`, that node is deleted.
      * **Time Complexity:** $O(N^2)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes, as for each node, we might iterate through the rest of the list.
      * **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ (constant), as no additional data structures are used.

2.  **Using a Hash Map (or Set):**

      * This approach uses a **hash map** (or a **set**) to keep track of the data values encountered so far.
      * We traverse the list with a single pointer (`temp`). For each node, we check if its data is already present in the hash map.
      * If the data is in the map, it's a duplicate, and the node is deleted.
      * If the data is not in the map, it's unique, so we add it to the map and move to the next node.
      * **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$ on average, as hash map operations (insertion and lookup) take $O(1)$ time on average.
      * **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$ in the worst case, as the hash map could store up to $N$ unique elements.

**Example of `removeNodes1` (Nested Loops):**

Consider the list: `1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 512 -> 16 -> 128 -> 512 -> 4 -> 16 -> 1 -> 4 -> 512 -> 512 -> 512 -> NULL`

1.  **`curr` is at `1`:**
      * Inner loop checks `4`, `2`, `512`, `16`, `128`, `512`, `4`, `16`.
      * Finds `1` again (the ninth node). Deletes it.
      * The list becomes: `1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 512 -> 16 -> 128 -> 512 -> 4 -> 16 -> 4 -> 512 -> 512 -> 512 -> NULL`
2.  **`curr` moves to `4`:**
      * Inner loop checks `2`, `512`, `16`, `128`, `512`.
      * Finds `4` (the eighth node). Deletes it.
      * Finds `4` again (the ninth node after deletion). Deletes it.
      * The list continues to be processed.

**Example of `removeNodes2` (Hash Map):**

Consider the list: `1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 512 -> 16 -> 128 -> 512 -> 4 -> 16 -> 1 -> 4 -> 512 -> 512 -> 512 -> NULL`

1.  **`temp` is at `1`:** Add `1` to `visited`. `visited = {1:true}`
2.  **`temp` moves to `4`:** Add `4` to `visited`. `visited = {1:true, 4:true}`
3.  **`temp` moves to `2`:** Add `2` to `visited`. `visited = {1:true, 4:true, 2:true}`
4.  **`temp` moves to `512`:** Add `512` to `visited`. `visited = {1:true, 4:true, 2:true, 512:true}`
5.  **`temp` moves to `16`:** Add `16` to `visited`. `visited = {1:true, 4:true, 2:true, 512:true, 16:true}`
6.  **`temp` moves to `128`:** Add `128` to `visited`. `visited = {..., 128:true}`
7.  **`temp` moves to `512`:** `512` is in `visited`. Delete this node.
8.  **`temp` (now pointing to the node that was after the deleted `512`) points to `4`:** `4` is in `visited`. Delete this node.
9.  **`temp` points to `16`:** `16` is in `visited`. Delete this node.
10. **`temp` points to `1`:** `1` is in `visited`. Delete this node.
    And so on, until all duplicates are removed.

Which approach is better depends on the constraints and requirements. If memory is extremely limited, the $O(1)$ space complexity of the nested loop approach might be preferred. However, for large lists, the $O(N)$ average time complexity of the hash map approach makes it significantly faster.

Do you want to explore other linked list operations or maybe delve into circular linked lists?
