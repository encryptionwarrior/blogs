### Sorting a Linked List of 0s, 1s, and 2s

Sorting a linked list that contains only three distinct values (0, 1, and 2) can be done very efficiently, without using general-purpose comparison-based sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort, which typically have higher time complexities for linked lists.

The provided `Sort012` function implements a common and optimal approach:

1.  **Counting Occurrences (First Pass):**

      * Traverse the entire linked list once.
      * Maintain three separate counters: `zero`, `one`, and `two`.
      * For each node encountered, increment the corresponding counter based on its `data` value.
      * **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes, as we visit each node exactly once.
      * **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a few integer variables for counters.

2.  **Overwriting Data (Second Pass):**

      * Reset a pointer back to the `head` of the list.
      * Based on the `zero` count, iterate and set the `data` of the first `zero` nodes to `0`.
      * Then, based on the `one` count, iterate and set the `data` of the next `one` nodes to `1`.
      * Finally, based on the `two` count, iterate and set the `data` of the remaining `two` nodes to `2`.
      * **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$, as we again visit each node exactly once to update its data.
      * **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$.

**Overall Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
**Overall Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

This method is highly efficient because it leverages the limited range of values (0, 1, 2). It's simpler and faster than manipulating node pointers for a general sort.

**Example:**

Consider the unsorted linked list: `1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> NULL`

1.  **First Pass (Counting):**

      * Traverse the list:
          * Node `1`: `one = 1`
          * Node `0`: `zero = 1`
          * Node `2`: `two = 1`
          * Node `1`: `one = 2`
          * Node `0`: `zero = 2`
          * Node `2`: `two = 2`
          * Node `0`: `zero = 3`
          * Node `1`: `one = 3`
          * Node `2`: `two = 3`
      * After the first pass: `zero = 3`, `one = 3`, `two = 3`.

2.  **Second Pass (Overwriting):**

      * Reset `temp` to point to the head of the list.
      * **Fill 0s:** `zero` is 3.
          * `temp->data = 0` (first node becomes 0)
          * `temp->data = 0` (second node becomes 0)
          * `temp->data = 0` (third node becomes 0)
          * List: `0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> NULL` (only first three nodes updated so far)
      * **Fill 1s:** `one` is 3.
          * `temp->data = 1` (fourth node becomes 1)
          * `temp->data = 1` (fifth node becomes 1)
          * `temp->data = 1` (sixth node becomes 1)
          * List: `0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> NULL` (only next three nodes updated)
      * **Fill 2s:** `two` is 3.
          * `temp->data = 2` (seventh node becomes 2)
          * `temp->data = 2` (eighth node becomes 2)
          * `temp->data = 2` (ninth node becomes 2)
          * List: `0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2 -> NULL` (fully sorted)

This method effectively sorts the list by value without changing the structure of the linked list itself, only the data within the nodes.
