### Quick Revision Note: Palindrome Check for Singly Linked List

**Problem:** Determine if a given singly linked list is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.

**Approach Used (`isPalindrome` function):**

1.  **Copy to Auxiliary Space (Vector):**

      * **Idea:** The simplest way to check for a palindrome in a singly linked list is to copy all its elements into a data structure that allows easy bidirectional access, like a `std::vector` (or an array).
      * **Process:** Traverse the linked list from head to tail. For each node, append its `data` to the `vector`.
      * **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes, as we visit each node once to copy its data.
      * **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$, as the `vector` will store all $N$ elements of the linked list.

2.  **Two-Pointer Check on Auxiliary Space:**

      * **Idea:** Once the elements are in the `vector`, checking for a palindrome becomes straightforward.
      * **Process:** Use two pointers, `start` at the beginning of the `vector` and `end` at the end. Move `start` forwards and `end` backwards, comparing elements at each step. If a mismatch is found, it's not a palindrome. If they meet or cross without mismatches, it is a palindrome.
      * **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$, as we iterate through at most half of the `vector`.
      * **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ (ignoring the space used by the `vector` itself, which is part of step 1).

**Overall Time Complexity:** $O(N)$ (dominated by the two passes over the list/vector)
**Overall Space Complexity:** $O(N)$ (due to storing all list elements in the vector)

**Example:**

Linked List: `54 -> 67 -> 34 -> 99 -> 34 -> 67 -> 54 -> NULL`

1.  **Copy to `vector`:**
    `newList = [54, 67, 34, 99, 34, 67, 54]`

2.  **Two-Pointer Check:**

      * `start = 0`, `end = 6`
      * `newList[0]` (54) == `newList[6]` (54) -\> Match. `start = 1`, `end = 5`
      * `newList[1]` (67) == `newList[5]` (67) -\> Match. `start = 2`, `end = 4`
      * `newList[2]` (34) == `newList[4]` (34) -\> Match. `start = 3`, `end = 3`
      * `start` is no longer less than `end`. Loop terminates.

Result: `true` (List is a palindrome)

**Alternative (More Optimal) Approach (Not implemented in the provided code but good for revision):**

For a singly linked list, a more space-efficient (but slightly more complex) approach would be:

1.  **Find Middle:** Use the "fast and slow pointer" method to find the middle of the linked list.
2.  **Reverse Second Half:** Reverse the linked list from the middle to the end.
3.  **Compare Halves:** Compare the first half of the original list with the reversed second half.
4.  **Restore List (Optional):** Reverse the second half back to restore the original list structure.

This alternative approach has:

  * **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$ (for finding middle, reversing, and comparing).
  * **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ (does not use auxiliary data structures proportional to N, only a few pointers). This is often preferred in interviews.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> // Includes all standard C++ libraries (e.g., iostream, vector, etc.)
using namespace std; // Uses the standard namespace

// Node class for a singly linked list
class Node {
public:
    int data;  // Data stored in the node
    Node* next; // Pointer to the next node

    // Constructor to create a new node
    Node(int data) {
        this->data = data; // Initialize data
        this->next = NULL; // Initialize next pointer to NULL
    }
};

// Function to print the linked list
void printList(Node* head) {
    if(head == NULL) { // Check if list is empty
        cout << "List is Empty!" << endl;
        return;
    }

    cout << "Singly List : ";
    while(head != NULL) { // Traverse and print data
        cout << head->data << " ";
        head = head->next;
    }
    cout << endl;
}

// Function to insert a new node at the head of the list
void insertAtHead(Node* &head, int data) {
    Node *temp = new Node(data); // Create new node
    temp->next = head;           // Link new node to current head
    head = temp;                 // Update head to new node
}

// Function to check if a singly linked list is a palindrome
// Approach: Create a reversed copy of the list and compare it with the original.
bool isPalindrome(Node* head) {
    Node* copy = NULL; // Head of the reversed copy list
    Node* temp = head; // Temporary pointer for original list traversal

    // Step 1: Create a reversed copy of the original linked list
    // By repeatedly inserting at the head of 'copy', we effectively reverse the order.
    while(temp != NULL) {
        insertAtHead(copy, temp->data); // Insert current node's data at head of 'copy'
        temp = temp->next;              // Move to next node in original list
    }

    // Step 2: Compare the original list with its reversed copy
    // 'head' still points to the original list's head.
    // 'copy' points to the head of the reversed copy.
    bool flag = true; // Flag to track if it's a palindrome (assume true initially)
    temp = copy;      // Use 'temp' to traverse the 'copy' list

    while(head != NULL) { // Iterate as long as original list has nodes
        if(head->data != temp->data) { // If data doesn't match
            flag = false; // Set flag to false
            break;        // No need to continue, it's not a palindrome
        }

        head = head->next; // Move to next node in original list
        temp = temp->next; // Move to next node in reversed copy
    }

    // Step 3: Deallocate memory used by the 'copy' list
    // (Important for good memory management, as 'copy' was dynamically allocated)
    while(copy != NULL) {
        Node* target = copy; // Pointer to the current node to be deleted
        copy = copy->next;   // Move 'copy' to the next node before deletion
        delete target;       // Deallocate the current node
    }

    return flag; // Return the palindrome check result
}

int main() {
    Node *head = NULL; // Initialize an empty linked list

    // Insert elements to create a palindrome list: 54 -> 67 -> 34 -> 99 -> 34 -> 67 -> 54
    // (Note: insertAtHead adds elements in reverse order of insertion calls)
    // List built: 54 (last inserted) -> 67 -> 34 -> 99 -> 34 -> 67 -> 54 (first inserted)
    // So the head will be 54. The actual list in memory is: 54 -> 67 -> 34 -> 99 -> 34 -> 67 -> 54
    insertAtHead(head, 54);
    insertAtHead(head, 67);
    insertAtHead(head, 34);
    insertAtHead(head, 99);
    insertAtHead(head, 34);
    insertAtHead(head, 67);
    insertAtHead(head, 54);

    printList(head); // Print the created list

    // Check and print if the list is a palindrome
    if(isPalindrome(head)) {
        cout << "List is palindrome!" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "List is not palindrome!" << endl;
    }

    return 0; // Indicate successful execution
}

### Quick Revision Note: Palindrome Check for Singly Linked List (Using Reversed Copy)

**Problem:** Determine if a given singly linked list reads the same forwards and backwards (i.e., is a palindrome).

**Approach Used (`isPalindrome` function):**

1.  **Create a Reversed Copy:**

      * **Idea:** Build a completely new linked list by traversing the original list and inserting each node's data at the *head* of the new list. Inserting at the head naturally reverses the order of elements.
      * **Process:**
          * Initialize `Node* copy = NULL;`
          * Iterate through the `original list` (using `temp` pointer).
          * For each `temp->data`, call `insertAtHead(copy, temp->data)`.
      * **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes, as we traverse the original list once and perform $N$ head insertions (each $O(1)$).
      * **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$, as we create a new linked list that is a full copy of the original.

2.  **Compare Original and Reversed Copy:**

      * **Idea:** Now that we have the original list (pointed to by `head`) and its reversed version (pointed to by `copy`), we can compare them element by element.
      * **Process:**
          * Use two pointers, one for `head` and one for `copy`.
          * Iterate simultaneously, comparing `head->data` and `copy->data`.
          * If any pair of corresponding elements do not match, the list is not a palindrome.
          * If both lists are traversed completely without a mismatch, it is a palindrome.
      * **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$, as we traverse both lists once.
      * **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ (ignoring the space used by the copied list, which is part of step 1).

3.  **Deallocate Copied List:**

      * **Important:** Since the `copy` list was dynamically allocated, it's crucial to deallocate its memory to prevent memory leaks. This is done by traversing `copy` and `delete`ing each node.
      * **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$.

**Overall Time Complexity:** $O(N)$ (dominated by the three passes: copy, compare, deallocate).
**Overall Space Complexity:** $O(N)$ (due to creating the full copy of the list).

**Example:**

Original List: `54 -> 67 -> 34 -> 99 -> 34 -> 67 -> 54 -> NULL`

1.  **Create Reversed Copy (`copy`):**

      * Insert `54` (from original head): `54 -> NULL` (`copy` points to this `54`)
      * Insert `67`: `67 -> 54 -> NULL` (`copy` points to `67`)
      * Insert `34`: `34 -> 67 -> 54 -> NULL` (`copy` points to `34`)
      * ...and so on.
      * Final `copy` list: `54 -> 67 -> 34 -> 99 -> 34 -> 67 -> 54 -> NULL` (which is indeed the reverse)

2.  **Compare Original (`head`) and Reversed Copy (`copy`):**

      * `head->data` (54) vs `copy->data` (54) -\> Match
      * `head->data` (67) vs `copy->data` (67) -\> Match
      * `head->data` (34) vs `copy->data` (34) -\> Match
      * `head->data` (99) vs `copy->data` (99) -\> Match
      * `head->data` (34) vs `copy->data` (34) -\> Match
      * `head->data` (67) vs `copy->data` (67) -\> Match
      * `head->data` (54) vs `copy->data` (54) -\> Match
      * Both lists become `NULL`.

Result: `true` (List is a palindrome)

-----

**Comparison with Vector Approach (Previous `isPalindrome`):**

  * **Similarities:** Both approaches use $O(N)$ time and $O(N)$ space complexity.
  * **Differences:**
      * The `vector` approach uses a `std::vector`, which might have slightly better cache performance due to contiguous memory, but involves potential reallocations.
      * This "reversed copy linked list" approach directly manipulates linked list nodes for the copy, which might be preferred if strictly sticking to linked list operations. Memory deallocation is a manual step.

**More Optimal Approach (O(1) Space - for revision):**

As mentioned in the previous note, the most optimal solution for space efficiency ($O(1)$ space) involves:

1.  Finding the middle of the linked list (using fast/slow pointers).
2.  Reversing the second half of the linked list.
3.  Comparing the first half with the reversed second half.
4.  (Optional but good practice) Reversing the second half back to restore the original list.
    This approach avoids creating a full copy, making it more memory-efficient.

### Quick Revision Note: Palindrome Check for Singly Linked List (Optimized O(1) Space)

**Problem:** Determine if a singly linked list is a palindrome efficiently, ideally without using extra space proportional to the list size.

**Core Idea:**
A linked list is a palindrome if its first half matches the reverse of its second half.

**Approach Used (`isPalindrome` function):**

1.  **Find the Middle of the List (`getMiddle`):**

      * **Method:** Use the "Floyd's Tortoise and Hare" (fast and slow pointer) algorithm.
          * `slow` pointer moves one step at a time.
          * `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time.
      * **Result:** When `fast` reaches the end (or `NULL`), `slow` will be at the middle node of the list. For even length lists, `slow` will be the last node of the first half. For odd length, `slow` will be the actual middle node.
      * **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$, for a single traversal.
      * **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$.

2.  **Reverse the Second Half of the List (`reverse`):**

      * **Method:**
          * Identify the start of the second half: `middle->next`.
          * Temporarily break the link between the first and second halves: `middle->next = NULL;`. This isolates the first half.
          * Use a standard iterative linked list reversal algorithm on the second half.
      * **Result:** The second half of the list is now reversed.
      * **Time Complexity:** $O(N/2)$, approximately $O(N)$, for reversing half the list.
      * **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$.

3.  **Compare the First Half with the Reversed Second Half:**

      * **Method:**
          * Use one pointer (`head1`) starting from the original `head`.
          * Use another pointer (`head2`) starting from the head of the *reversed* second half.
          * Compare `head1->data` and `head2->data` sequentially.
      * **Result:** If all corresponding data matches until `head2` becomes `NULL`, the list is a palindrome. If a mismatch occurs, it's not.
      * **Time Complexity:** $O(N/2)$, approximately $O(N)$.
      * **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$.

4.  **Restore the Original List (Crucial for Function Reusability):**

      * **Method:** This step is important if you intend for the original linked list structure to remain unchanged after the `isPalindrome` call.
          * Reverse the (now compared) second half back to its original order.
          * Reconnect the two halves: Set `middle->next` back to the (now re-reversed) head of the second half.
      * **Time Complexity:** $O(N/2)$, approximately $O(N)$.
      * **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$.

**Overall Time Complexity:** $O(N)$ (dominated by multiple traversals/reversals, each linear).
**Overall Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ (constant extra space, as no auxiliary data structures growing with N are used).

**Example:**

List: `54 -> 67 -> 34 -> 99 -> 34 -> 67 -> 54 -> NULL` (Length 7)

1.  **`getMiddle(head)`:**

      * `slow` goes `54 -> 67 -> 34 -> 99`
      * `fast` goes `54 -> 34 -> 34 -> 54 -> NULL` (reaches end)
      * `middle` points to `99`.
      * `headOfSecondHalf` (initially `middle->next`) becomes `34`.
      * `middle->next = NULL` breaks list: `54 -> 67 -> 34 -> 99 -> NULL` and `34 -> 67 -> 54 -> NULL`.

2.  **`reverse(headOfSecondHalf)`:**

      * The second half `34 -> 67 -> 54 -> NULL` becomes `54 -> 67 -> 34 -> NULL`.
      * `headOfSecondHalf` now points to `54` (the new head of the reversed second half).

3.  **Compare:**

      * `head1` (original head `54`) vs `head2` (reversed second half head `54`) -\> Match.
      * `head1` (67) vs `head2` (67) -\> Match.
      * `head1` (34) vs `head2` (34) -\> Match.
      * `head1` (99) vs `head2` (NULL) -\> Comparison stops here. `head2` is `NULL`. The comparison `while(head1 != NULL && head2 != NULL)` covers this.
      * The loop finishes without `palindrome` being set to `false`.

4.  **Restore:** (Not shown in example trace for brevity, but happens in code)

      * `reverse(headOfSecondHalf)` reverses it back to `34 -> 67 -> 54 -> NULL`.
      * `middle->next = headOfSecondHalf` reconnects `99 -> 34`.

Result: `true` (List is a palindrome)

This optimized method is generally preferred in coding interviews due to its superior space complexity.
