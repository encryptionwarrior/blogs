### Code
```c++
void bubbleSort(vector<int>& arr, int n)
{   
    // Loop for each sorting round from 1 to n-1
    for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        bool swapped = false;  // Track if any swap occurs in this round
        
        // Inner loop to compare adjacent elements and swap if needed
        for(int j = 0; j < n - i; j++) {
            
            // If the current element is greater than the next, swap them
            if(arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {
                swap(arr[j], arr[j+1]);
                swapped = true;  // Mark that a swap occurred
            }
        }
        
        // If no swap occurred, the array is already sorted
        if(!swapped) {
            break;  // Exit early to optimize
        }
    }
}
```

### Example:
```c++
vector<int> arr = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11};
int n = 5;
```
##### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. Initial Array:\
`arr[] = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11}`.

2. Outer Loop (i = 1):
    - Swapped = false.
    - Inner Loop (comparing adjacent elements):
        - Compare `arr[0] (64)` and `arr[1] (25)` → Swap → `arr[] = {25, 64, 12, 22, 11}`.
        - Compare `arr[1] (64)` and `arr[2] (12)` → Swap → `arr[] = {25, 12, 64, 22, 11}`.
        - Compare `arr[2] (64`) and `arr[3] (22)` → Swap → `arr[] = {25, 12, 22, 64, 11}`.
        - Compare `arr[3] (64)` and `arr[4] (11)` → Swap → `arr[] = {25, 12, 22, 11, 64}`.
    - Array after Round 1: `arr[] = {25, 12, 22, 11, 64}` (64 is in its correct position).
3. Outer Loop (i = 2):

    - Swapped = false.
    - Inner Loop:
        - Compare `arr[0] (25)` and `arr[1] (12)` → Swap → `arr[] = {12, 25, 22, 11, 64}`.
        - Compare `arr[1] (25)` and `arr[2] (22)` → Swap → `arr[] = {12, 22, 25, 11, 64}`.
        - Compare `arr[2] (25)` and `arr[3] (11)` → Swap → `arr[] = {12, 22, 11, 25, 64}`.
    - Array after Round 2: `arr[] = {12, 22, 11, 25, 64}` (25 and 64 are in correct positions).
4. Outer Loop (i = 3):

    - Swapped = false.
    - Inner Loop:
         - Compare `arr[0] (12)` and `arr[1] (22)` → No Swap.
         - Compare `arr[1] (22)` and `arr[2] (11)` → Swap → `arr[] = {12, 11, 22, 25, 64}`.
    - Array after Round 3: `arr[] = {12, 11, 22, 25, 64}` (22, 25, 64 are in correct positions).
5. Outer Loop (i = 4):

    - Swapped = false.
    - Inner Loop:
        - Compare `arr[0] (12)` and `arr[1] (11)` → Swap → `arr[] = {11, 12, 22, 25, 64}`.
    - Array after Round 4: `arr[] = {11, 12, 22, 25, 64}` (sorted).
6. The algorithm ends after Round 4 because no swaps were made in the next round, indicating the array is sorted.

###### Final Sorted Array:
- After sorting, the array is:
`arr[] = {11, 12, 22, 25, 64}`.
