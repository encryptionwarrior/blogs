### Question: 1. Age Group Categorization
#### Classify a person's age group: Child (< 13), Teenager (13-19), Adult (20-59), Senior (60+).

```py
age = 65

if age < 13:
    print("Child")
elif age < 20:
    print("Teenager")
elif age < 60:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Senior")
```

### question: 2. Movie Ticket Pricing
#### Problem: Movie tickets are priced based on age: $12 for adults (18 and over), $8 for children. Everyone gets a $2 discount on Wednesday.

```py
age = 26

day = "Wednesday"

price = 12 if age >= 18 else 8

if day == "Wednesday":
    price -= 2

print("Ticket price for you is $", price)
```

### qustion: 3. Grade Calculator
#### Problem: Assign a letter grade based on a student's score: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60).

```py
score = 89

if score >= 101:
    print("Please verify your grade again")
    exit()

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 60:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"

print("Grade: ", grade)
```

### 4. Fruit Ripeness Checker
#### Problem: Determine if a fruit is ripe, overripe, or unripe based on its color. (e.g., Banana: Green - Unripe, Yellow - Ripe, Brown - Overripe)

```py
fruit = "Banana"
color = "Yellow"

if fruit == "Banana":
    if color == "Green":
        print("Unripe")
    elif color == "Yellow":
        print("Ripe")
    elif color == "Brown":
        print("OverRipe")
```

### 5. Weather Activity Suggestion
#### Problem: Suggest an activity based on the weather (e.g., Sunny - Go for a walk, Rainy - Read a book, Snowy - Build a snowman).

```py
weather = "Sunny"

if weather == "Sunny":
    activity = "Go for a walk"
elif weather == "Rainy":
    activity = "Read a book"
elif weather == "Snowy":
    activity = "Build a snowman"
```

### 6. Transportation Mode Selection
#### Problem: Choose a mode of transportation based on the distance (e.g.,` <3 km: Walk, 3-15 km: Bike,` >15 km: Car).


```py
distance = 5

if distance < 3:
    transport = "Walk"
elif distance <= 15:
    transport = "Bike"
else:
    transport = "Car"

print("AI recommends you the transport of: ", transport)
```

### 7. Coffee Customization
#### Problem: Customize a coffee order: "Small", "Medium", or "Large" with an option for "Extra shot" of espresso.

```py 
order_size = "Medium"
extra_shot = True

if extra_shot:
    coffee = order_size + " coffee with an extra shot"
else:
    coffee = order_size + " coffee"

print("Order: ", coffee)
```

### 8. Password Strength Checker
#### Problem: Check if a password is "Weak", "Medium", or "Strong". Criteria: < 6 chars (Weak), 6-10 chars (Medium), >10 chars (Strong).

```py 
password = "Secure3P@ss"
password_length = len(password)

if len(password) < 6:
    strength = "Weak"
elif len(password) <= 10:
    strength = "Medium"
else:
    strength = "Strong"

print("Password strength is: ", strength)
```

### 9. Leap Year Checker
#### Problem: Determine if a year is a leap year. (Leap years are divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400).

```py 
year = 2023
if(year % 400 == 0) or (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0):
    print(year, " is a leap year")
else:
    print(year, " is NOT a leap year")
```

### 10. Pet Food Recommendation
#### Problem: Recommend a type of pet food based on the pet's species and age. (e.g., Dog: `<2 years - Puppy food, Cat: >`5 years - Senior cat food).
