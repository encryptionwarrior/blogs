## Database
Database is collection of data in a format that can be easily accessed (Digital)
A software application used to manage our DB is called DBMS (Database Management System)

### Types of Databases 
- **Relational**: Data Stored in tables 
    - Mysql
    - ORACLE
    - SQL SERVER
    - PostGreSQL
- **Non-Relational**: Data Stored in tables 
    - MongoDB

### What is SQL
SQL(Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to interact with relational databases.

It is used to perform CRUD operations :
Create, Read, Update, Delete

### Creating Our First Database 
```sql
CREATE DATABASE db_name;
DROP DATABASE db_name;
```

### Creating Our First Table
```sql 
USE db_name;
CREATE TABLE table_name (
column_name1 datatype constraint,
column_name2 datatype constraint,
column_name2 datatype constraint
);
```

### SQL Datatypes
| Datatype      | Description                          | Usage                                   |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|

## Types of SQL Commands 
<span class="text-sky-500 font-bold">DDL</span>(Data Definition Language): create, alter, rename, truncate & drop

<span class="text-sky-500 font-bold">DQL</span>(Data Query Language): select

<span class="text-sky-500 font-bold">DML</span>(Data Manipulation Language): select, insert, update & delete

<span class="text-sky-500 font-bold">DCL</span>(Data Control Language): grant & revoke permission to users

## Database related Queries 
```sql
CREATE DATABASE db_name;
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db_name;
DROP DATABASE db_name;
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS db_name;
SHOW DATABASES;
SHOW TABLES;
```

## Table related Queries 
- Create
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
column_name1 datatype constraint,
column_name2 datatype constraint,
);
```

- Select & View ALL columns
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```
- Insert
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name
(colname1, colname2);
VALUES
(col1_v1, col2_v1),
(col1_v2, col2_v2);
```

### Keys
- **Primary Key**
    - It is a column (or set of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each row. (a unique id)
    - There is only 1 PK & it should be NOT null.
- **Foreign Key**
    - A foreign key is a column (or set of columns) in a table that refers to the primary key in another table.
    - There can be multiple FKs.
    - FKs can have duplicate & null values.

## Constraints
SQL constraints are used to specify rules for data in a table.
- **NOT NULL** : columns cannot have a null value
- **UNIQUE** : all values in column are different
- **PRIMARY KEY** : makes a column unique & not null but used only for one
```sql
col1 INT NOT NULL;
col2 INT NOT UNIQUE;
id INT PRIMARY KEY;

CREATE TABLE temp (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```
- **FOREIGN KEY** : prevent actions that would destroy links between tables
- **DEFAULT** : sets the default value of a column
```sql
CREATE TABLE temp (
    cust_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (cust_id) REFERENCES customer(id)
);

salary INT DEFAULT 25000;
```

- **CHECK** : it can limit the values allowed in a column
```sql
CREATE TABLE city (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    city VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    CONSTRAINT age_check CHECK (age >= 18 AND city="Delhi")
);

CREATE TABLE newMap(
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18)
);
```

### Select in Detail
used to select any data from the database
- Basic Syntax
```sql
SELECT col1, col2 FROM table_name;
```
- To select All
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

### Where Clause
To define some conditions
- Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT col1, col2 FROM table_name
WHERE conditions;
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks > 80;
SELECT * FROM student WHERE city = "Mumbai";
```
#### Using Operators in WHERE

- **Arithmetic Operators** : `+(addition) , -(subtraction), *(multiplication), /(division), %(modulus)`
- **Comparison Operators** : `= (equal to), != (not equal to), > , >=, <, <=`
- **Logical Operators** : `AND, OR , NOT, IN, BETWEEN, ALL, LIKE, ANY`
- **Bitwise Operators** : `& (Bitwise AND), | (Bitwise OR)`

### Operators
- **AND** (to check for both conditions to be true)
```sql
SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks > 80 AND city = "Mumbai";
```
- **OR** (to check for one of the conditions to be true)
```sql
SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks > 80 OR city = "Mumbai";
```
- **BETWEEN** (selects for a given range)
```sql
SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks BETWEEN 80 AND 90;
```
- **IN** (matches any value in the list)
```sql
SELECT * FROM student WHERE city IN("Delhi", "Mumbai");
```
- **NOT** (to negate the given condition)
```sql
SELECT * FROM student WHERE city NOT IN("Delhi", "Mumbai");
```
### Limit Clause
Sets an upper limit on number of (tuples)rows to be returned
```sql
SELECT * FROM student LIMIT 3;

SELECT col1, col2 FROM table_name LIMIT number;
```
### Order By Clause
To sort in ascending (ASC) or descending order (DESC)
```sql
SELECT * FROM student ORDER BY city ASC;

SELECT col1, col2 FROM table_name ORDER BY col_name(s) ASC;
```
### Aggragate Functions
Aggregare functions perform a calculation on a set of values, and return a single value.
- COUNT() 
- MAX()
- MIN()
- SUM()
- AVG()

Get Maximum Marks
```sql
SELECT MAX(marks) FROM student;
```
 Get Average marks
```sql
SELECT AVG(marks) FROM student;
```

### Group By Clause
Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.\
It collects data from multiple records and groups the result by one or more column.
- Generally we use group by with some aggregation function.
- Count number of students in each city
```sql
SELECT city, COUNT(name)
FROM student 
GROUP BY city;
```

### Having Clause
Similar to Where i.e. applies some condition on rows.\
Used when we want to apply any condition after grouping.
- Count number of students in each city where max marks cross 90.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(name), city
FROM student 
GROUP BY city
HAVING MAX(marks) > 90;
```

### General Order
**SELECT** column(s)\
**FROM** table_name\
**WHERE** condition\
**GROUP** BY column(s)\
**HAVING** condition\
**ORDER** BY column(s) ASC;\

## Table Related Queries
### Update (to update existing rows)
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET col1 = val1, col2 = val2
WHERE condition;
```
```sql
UPDATE student
SET grade = "O"
WHERE grade = "A";
```
### Delete (to delete existing rows)
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
```sql
DELETE FROM student
WHERE marks < 33;
```
### Alter (to change the schema)
- ADD Column

Syntax
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN column_name datatype constraint;
```
Example
```sql
ALTER TABLE student
ADD COLUMN age INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 19;
```

- DROP Column

Syntax
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;
```
Example
```sql
ALTER TABLE student
DROP COLUMN stu_age;
```
- RENAME Table

Syntax
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
RENAME TO new_table_name;
```
Example
```sql
ALTER TABLE student
RENAME TO stu;
```
- CHANGE Column (rename)

Syntax
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
CHANGE COLUMN old_name new_name new_datatype new_constraint;
```
Example
```sql
ALTER TABLE student
CHANGE age stu_age INT;
```
- MODIFY Column (modify datatype/ constraint)

Syntax
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY col_name new_datatype new_constraint;
```
Example
```sql
ALTER TABLE student
MODIFY age VARCHAR(2);
```
- Truncate (to delete table's data)

Syntax
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```
Example
```sql
UPDATE student
SET grade = "0"
WHERE grade = "A";
```

## Joins in SQL
Join is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
### Types of Joins
- Inner Join
- Left Join
- Right Join
- Full Join

#### Inner Join
Returns records that have matching values in both tables

Syntax
```sql
SELECT column(s)
FROM tableA
INNER JOIN tableB
ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name;
```
Example
```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
INNER JOIN course
ON student.student_id = course.student_id;
```
#### Left Join
Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from
the right table

Syntax
```sql
SELECT column(s)
FROM tableA
LEFT JOIN tableB
ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name;
```
Example
```sql
SELECT *
FROM student as s
LEFT JOIN course as c
ON s.student_id = c.student_id;
```
#### Right Join
Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from
the right table

Syntax
```sql
SELECT column(s)
FROM tableA
RIGHT JOIN tableB
ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name;
```
Example
```sql
SELECT *
FROM student as s
RIGHT JOIN course as c
ON s.student_id = c.student_id;
```
#### Full Join
Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

Syntax
```sql
LEFT JOIN
UNION
RIGHT JOIN

SELECT column(s)
FROM tableA 
LEFT JOIN tableB
ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name
UNION
SELECT column(s)
FROM tableA
LEFT JOIN tableB
ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name;

```
Example
```sql
SELECT *
FROM student as a
LEFT JOIN course as b
ON a.student_id = b.student_id
UNION
SELECT *
FROM student as a
RIGHT JOIN course as b
ON a.student_id = b.student_id
```
#### Self Join
It is a regular join but the table is joined with itself.

Syntax
```sql
SELECT column(s)
FROM table as a
JOIN table as b
ON a.col_name = b.col_name;
```
Example
```sql
SELECT a.name as manager_name, b.name
FROM employee as a
JOIN employee as b
ON a.id = b.manager_id
```
#### Union
It is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.\
Gives UNIQUE records

To use it :
- every SELECT should have same no. of columns
- columns must have similar data types
- columns in every SELECT should be in same order

Syntax
```sql
SELECT column(s) FROM tableA
UNION
SELECT column(s) FROM tableB
```
