## SQL Practice Commands
- commands
<Code code="CREATE DATABASE temp1;" lang="sql" />
<Code code="create database temp1;" lang="sql" />
<Code code="CREATE DATABASE college;" lang="sql" />

- Delete database
<Code code="DROP DATABASE temp1;" lang="sql" />
<Code code="DROP DATABASE temp2;" lang="sql" />

- Use database
```sql
USE college;
```

- Create first table
```sql
CREATE DATABASE college;
USE college;

CREATE TABLE student (
id INT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(50),
age INT NOT NULL
);
```
```sql
INSERT INTO student VALUES(1, "AMAN", 26);
// INSERT INTO student VALUES(1, "SHRADDHA", 24); // gives error because both have same id
INSERT INTO student VALUES(2, "SHRADDHA", 24); // gives error because both have same id
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM student;
```

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS college;
```
```sql
DROP DATABASE IF NOT company;
```
```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```
```sql
SHOW TABLES;
```
```sql
DROP TABLE student;
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
	rollno INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);
```
```sql
INSERT INTO student
(rollno, name)
VALUES
(101, "karan"),
(102, "arjun"),
(103, "ram");
```
- Used fo store single colums data
```sql
INSERT INTO student VALUES(104, "shyam");
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM student;
```

- Practice Question
```sql
CREATE DATABASE xyz_company;

USE xyz_company;

CREATE TABLE employee(
id INT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(50),
salary INT
);

INSERT INTO employee
(id, name, salary)
VALUES
(1, "adam", 25000),
(2, "bob", 30000),
(3, "casey", 40000);

SELECT * FROM employee;
```
- Constraints
```sql
CREATE TABLE temp1(
id INT UNIQUE
);

INSERT INTO temp1 VALUES(101);
INSERT INTO temp1 VALUES(101);
```

- Primary KEY
```sql
CREATE TABLE temp1(
id INT,
name VARCHAR(50),
aget INT,
city VARCHAR(20),
PRIMARY KEY (id, name)
);
```

- DEFAULT VALUES
```sql
CREATE TABLE emp(
	id INT,
    salary INT DEFAULT 25000
);

INSERT INTO emp (id) VALUES(101);
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
	rollno INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    marks INT NOT NULL,
    grade VARCHAR(1),
    city VARCHAR(20)
);

INSERT INTO student
(rollno, name, marks, grade, city)
VALUES
(101, "anil", 78, "C", "Pune"),
(102, "bhumika", 93, "A", "Mumbai"),
(103, "chetan", 95, "B", "Mumbai"),
(104, "dhruv", 96, "A", "Delhi"),
(105, "emanuel", 12, "F", "Delhi"),
(106, "Farrah", 82, "B", "Delhi");

```

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM student;
SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks > 80;
SELECT * FROM student WHERE city = "Mumbai";
SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks > 80 AND city = "Mumbai";
SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks + 10  > 100;
SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks > 90 AND city="Mumbai";
SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks > 90 OR city="Mumbai";
SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks BETWEEN 80 AND 90;
SELECT * FROM student WHERE city IN ("Delhi", "Mumbai", "Gurgaon");
SELECT * FROM student WHERE city NOT IN ("Delhi", "Mumbai", "Gurgaon");
SELECT * FROM student LIMIT 3;
SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks > 75 LIMIT 3;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM student ORDER BY city ASC;
SELECT * FROM student ORDER BY marks ASC;
SELECT * FROM student ORDER BY marks DESC LIMIT 3;
```
- Aggregate
```sql
SELECT MAX(marks) FROM student;
SELECT MIN(marks) FROM student;
SELECT AVG(marks) FROM student;
SELECT COUNT(rollno) FROM student;
```

- Group BY
```sql
SELECT city FROM student GROUP BY city;
SELECT city, name, COUNT(rollno) FROM student GROUP BY city, name;
```

- Practice Question- 1
```sql
SELECT city, avg (marks) FROM student GROUP BY city ORDER BY avg (marks) DESC;
```
- Practice Question- 2
```sql
SELECT mode, count(customers) FROM payment GROUP BY mode;
```
- Count
```sql
SELECT grade, count(rollno) FROM student GROUP BY grade ORDER BY grade;
```

- Having
```sql
SELECT city, count(rollno) FROM student GROUP BY city HAVING MAX(marks) > 90;
```
- Order of Clauses
```sql
SELECT city FROM student WHERE grade="A" GROUP BY city HAVING MAX(marks) > 90 ORDER BY city DESC;
```

- closee Safe Mode
```sql
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
```

- UPDATE
```sql
UPDATE student SET grade = "O" WHERE grade = "A";
```
```sql
UPDATE student SET marks = 82 WHERE rollno = 105;
```
```sql
UPDATE student SET grade = "B" WHERE marks BETWEEN 80 AND 90;
```
```sql
UPDATE student SET marks = marks + 1;
```

- DELETE
```sql
DELETE FROM student WHERE marks < 33;
```

- Foreign Key
```sql
CREATE TABLE dept (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE teacher (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
    dept_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES dept(id)
);

```

- cascade foreign key
```sql
CREATE TABLE teacher (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
    dept_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES dept(id),
    ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    ON DELETE CASCADE
);

INSERT INTO dept VALUES 
(101, "english"),
(102, "IT");

INSERT INTO teacher VALUES 
(101, "Adam", 101),
(102, "Eve", 102);

UPDATE dept SET id = 103 WHERE ID = 102;
```

#### Table Related queries
- Alter
```sql
ALTER TABLE student ADD COLUMN age INT;
```
- Delete Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE student DROP COLUMN age;
```
- Practice queries
```sql
ALTER TABLE student ADD COLUMN age INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 19;
```
```sql
ALTER TABLE student MODIFY COLUMN age VARCHAR(50);

INSERT INTO student
(rollno, name, marks, age)
 VALUES 
(107, "Gargi", 68, 100);
```

- Change
```sql
ALTER TABLE student CHANGE age stu_age INT;
```
- Delete
```sql
ALTER TABLE student DROP COLUMN stu_age;
```
- Rename
```sql
ALTER TABLE student RENAME TO stu;
```

- Delete Table Data
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE student;
```

- Practice Question
```sql
ALTER TABLE student CHANGE name full_name VARCHAR(50);
DELETE FROM student WHERE marks < 80; 
ALTER TABLE student DROP COLUMN grade;
```

SELECT * FROM student as s INNER JOIN course as c ON s.id = c.id;
```

- Left Join

SELECT * FROM student as s RIGHT JOIN course as c ON s.id = c.id;
```
- Full Join
```sql
SELECT * FROM student as s LEFT JOIN course as c ON s.id = c.id
UNION
SELECT * FROM student as s RIGHT JOIN course as c ON s.id = c.id;
```
- Left Exclusive Join
```sql
SELECT * FROM student as s LEFT JOIN course as c ON s.id = c.id WHERE c.id IS NULL;
```
- Right Exclusive Join
```sql
SELECT * FROM student as s RIGHT JOIN course as c ON s.id = c.id WHERE s.id IS NULL;
```

### Self Join
```sql
CREATE TABLE employee (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    manager_id INT
);

INSERT INTO employee (id, name, manager_id)
VALUES
(101, "adam", 103),
(102, "bob", 104),
(103, "cessy", null),
(104, "donald", 103);

SELECT a.name as manager_name, b.name FROM employee as a JOIN employee as b ON a.id = b.manager_id;

```

- Union
```sql
SELECT name FROM employee
UNION
SELECT name FROM employee
```
```sql
SELECT name FROM employee
UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM employee
```

##### Sub Queries
- Example: 1
```sql
SELECT name, marks
FROM student
WHERE marks > (SELECT AVG(marks) FROM student);
```
- Example: 2
```sql
SELECT name, marks
FROM student
WHERE rollno IN (SELECT rollno FROM student WHERE rollno % 2 = 0);
```
- Example: FROM
```sql
SELECT MAX(marks)
FROM (SELECT * FROM student WHERE city = "Delhi") AS temp;
```
- Example: SELECT
```sql
SELECT (SELECT MAX(marks) FROM student), name FROM student;
```

##### View
```sql
CREATE VIEW view1 AS
SELECT rollno, name, marks FROM student;

SELECT * FROM view1;
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM view1 WHERE marks > 90;
